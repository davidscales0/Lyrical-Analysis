Check in\n\n[Verse 2: Future]\nAyy, my eyes open (Open), but I'm barely awake (Future)\nThey say my codeine purple (Purple), and your beauty is ayy (Ayy)\nYour beauty takin' me away (Space), I'm smokin' on that good Cali\nI'm gettin' higher than Hollywood, get deep in your valley\nAs you get lower than lowrider, your favorite ghostwriter\nCould be jumpin' the gun (Gun), I might go over beyond\nPurchase a one-way ticket, don't know when you'll return (Come here)\nI need to roll me a blunt, 'cause you done blew this joint (Ha)\nThey say the stars all line up (Line), then they bring out the sun (Sun)\nHey, this a red carpet event (What?), I'ma bring out that one\nShe so sophisticated ('Cated), I brought her presidential Rollies\nI'm no longer faded (Ayy), she got me sober off of conversation (Turn up)\nI'm no longer faded (Ayy), she got me sober off of conversation (Turn up)\n[Chorus: Mac Miller]\nYou ain't gotta worry if you're cold\nI promise, baby, I'll be there by tomorrow\nFrom the beginnin', I'll be down for it all\n'Cause I ain't seen nobody like you\nAnd you looked so good when you walked by\nI had to stop, you blew my high\nA real angel bring you back to Earth15Embed"
