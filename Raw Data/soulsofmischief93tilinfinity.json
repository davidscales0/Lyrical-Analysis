This is Tajai of the mighty Souls of Mischief crew\nI'm chillin' with my man Phesto, my man A-Plus\nAnd my man Op', you know he's dope\n(Yo, yeah, you know what I'm sayin'?)\nBut right now, y'know, we just maxin' in the studio (Chillin')\nWe hailin' from East Oakland, California (Yeah)\nAnd, um, sometimes it gets a little hectic out there\n(Haha, we just chillin')\nBut right now, yo, we gon' up you on how we just chill\n\n[Verse 1: Opio]\nDial the seven digits, call up Bridgette\nHer man's a midget, plus she got friends, yo, I can dig it!\nHere's a 40 \u2014 swig it! You know it's frigid\nI got 'em chillin' in the cooler, break out the ruler\nDamn! That's the fattest stoge I ever seen\nThe weather's keen in Cali\nGettin' weeded makes it feel like Maui\nNow we feel the good vibrations\nSo many females, so much inspiration\n\n[Verse 2: A-Plus]\nI get inspired by the blunts too! (Too)\nI'll front you (You), if you hang with a bunk crew (Chump)\nI roam the strip for bones to pick\nWhen I find one, I'm gon'\nTake her home and quickly do this (Yep)\nI need not explain this (Nah!)\nA-Plus is famous, so get the anus!\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Tajai]\nHey, Miss! Who's there? I'm through there\nNo time to do hair; the flick's at eight, so get straight\nYou look great, let's grub now\nA rubdown sounds flavor, later there's the theater\n(Yeah, that sounds nice)\nWe in the cut, the cinema was mediocre (It was cool, you know)\nTake her to the crib so I can stroke her\n\n[Verse 4: Phesto]\nKids get broke for they skins when I'm in\nClose range, I throws game at your dip like handball\n'Cause the man's all that! All phat!\nI'm D to chill from '93 'til (Aha!)\n\n[Chorus: Souls of Mischief]\nYeah, this is how we chill from '93 'til (Yeah)\nThis is how we chill from '93 'til\nThis is how we chill from '93 'til\nThis is how we chill from '93 'til\nUh-huh, this is how we chill from '93 'til\nThis is how we chill from '93 'til\nThis is how we chill from '93 'til\nThis is how we chill\u2026 from '93 'til\n\n[Verse 5: A-Plus]\nHuh! My black Timbs do me well (Yeah)\nWhen I see a fool and he says he heard me tell (What?)\nAnother person's busy-ness, I cause dizziness\nUntil you stop actin' like a silly bitch\n[Verse 6: Phesto]\nYo, crews are jealous 'cause we get props\nThe cops wanna stop our fun, but the top\nIs where we're dwellin', swell and fat, no sleep\nI work fit, and jerks get their hoes sweeped\nUnder their noses, this bro's quick\nTo hit blunts and flip once I'm chillin' 'cause my crew's close, kid\n\n[Verse 7: Tajai]\nI'm posted, most kids accept this as cool\nI exit, 'cause I'm an exception to the rule (Hell no, I'm out)\nI'm steppin' to the cool spots where crews flock\n(Yo what's up, how you doin'?)\nTo snare a dip, or see where the shit that's flam-bee\nPlan B not as poppin'\nSo I got tons of indo and go to the Owen's basement\nMy ace been fattenin' up tracks\nTime to get prolific with the whiz, kid\n\n[Verse 8: Opio]\nGreenbacks in stacks, don't even ask who got the fat stacks\nWe can max pumpin' phat tracks\nExchangin' facts about impacts, 'cause in facts\nMy freestyle talent overpowers, brothers can't hack it\nThey lack wit, we got the mack shit\n'93 to infinity \u2014 kill all that wack shit!\n[Chorus: Souls of Mischief]\nHa! This is how we chill from '93 till\nThis is how we chill from '93 'til\nThis is how we chill from '93 'til\nThis is how we chill\u2026 from '93 'til\nYeah, this is how we chill from '93 'til' (Uh-huh)\nThis is how we chill from '93 'til\nThis is how we chill from '93 until\nThis is how we chill from '93 'til (Yeah)\n\n[Verse 9: Phesto]\nI be coolin', school's in session, but I'm fresh in\nRappin', so I take time off to never rhyme soft\nI'm off on my own shit with my own clique\nRoll many back-roads with a fat stoge and blunts, foldin' runts\nHoldin' stunts captive with my persona\nPlus a bomber, zestin'\nNiggas is testin' my patience, but I stay fresh and\n\n[Verse 10: Tajai]\nRestin' at the mall, attendance on 'noid (Get off!)\nBut I am shoppin' for my wish to exploit\nSome few fits, some new kicks\nI often do this, 'cause it's the pits not bein' dipped\n\n[Verse 11: Opio]\nFlipped! The flyer attire females desire\nBaby, you can step to this if you admire\nThe exxx-traordinary dapper rapper\nKeep tabs on your main squeeze before I tap her\n\n[Verse 12: A-Plus]\nI mack her, attack her with the smoothness\nI do this, peepin' what my crew gets, huh! (Shit)\nLoot, props, respect and blunts to pass\nCrews talk shit, but in my face, they kiss my ass (Smack!)\nThey bite flows, but we make up new ones\nIf you're really dope, why ain't you signed yet?\nBut I get my loot from Jive/Zomba, I'ma bomb ya\nYou will see, from now 'til infinity\n\n[Chorus: Souls of Mischief]\nAhhh (Yeah), this is how we chill from '93 'til\nThis is how we chill from '93 'til\nHuh!
