Hands off\u201d\nShorty must\u2019ve heard \u2018Fall For You\u2019 and now it\u2019s got her thinking that I\u2019m Vandross\nI tell her that ain\u2019t just got any girl, that\u2019s for babygirl, I\u2019m the man love\n(Yeah) and I ain\u2019t no dibby dibby rapper\nNiggas thinking shit\u2019s sweet because I\u2019m a singy singy rapper\nBut that\u2019s when it gets ugly, when a man comes through and tries mug me\nI been busy with the pen doing fuckery\nBlood look at the flick of the wrist trust me\nA man got gassed and her wrapped on a track cause I made it look easy\nAnd another man got pissed off \u2018cause his girl won\u2019t switch off, I been on repeat\nMe and my niggas do equal splits, I ain\u2019t got a brudda being all greedy\nIf I need something cheeky, I holla at Pep or I holla at Weezy\n\u2018Cause mans a fresh prince like Fresh Prince\nCame with the feel like Fresh Prince\nSpin an MC like Fresh Prince\nYou made one hit and been dead since\nI do not act all precious, I made one flow and then left it\nNigga ain\u2019t got that tekkers\nHold up this is the best bit\n\n[Hook]\nYes indeed, I got the recipe\nTempos change but nobody\u2019s been testing me\nBlessed indeed, make the beat rest in peace\nAnd life is calm, I ain\u2019t got a girl stressing me1Embed"
