And look where it's at\nMiddle America, now it's a tragedy\nNow it's so sad to see, an upper-class city\nHavin' this happenin', then attack\nEminem 'cause I rap this way, but I'm glad\n'Cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn\nAnd it's burnin', and I have returned\n[Chorus]\nAnd I am whatever you say I am\nIf I wasn't, then why would I say I am?\nIn the paper, the news, every day I am\nRadio won't even play my jam\n'Cause I am whatever you say I am\nIf I wasn't, then why would I say I am?\nIn the paper, the news, every day I am\nHa, I don't know, that's just the way I am\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm so sick and tired of bein' admired\nThat I wish that I would just die or get fired\nAnd dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables\nI'm not gonna be able to top a \"My Name Is\"\nAnd pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation\nTo cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations\nAnd I just do not got the patience\nTo deal with these cocky Caucasians who think\nI'm some wigger who just tries to be Black 'cause I talk\nWith an accent and grab on my balls so they always\nKeep askin' the same fuckin' questions\nWhat school did I go to, what hood I grew up in\nThe why, the who, what, when, the where, and the how\n'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out (Argh)\n'Cause they drivin' me crazy, I can't take it\nI'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit\nAnd I'm thankful for every fan that I get\nBut I can't take a shit in the bathroom without\nSomeone standin' by it! No, I won't sign your autograph\nYou can call me an asshole, I'm glad\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I am whatever you say I am\nIf I wasn't, then why would I say I am?\nIn the paper, the news, every day I am\nRadio won't even play my jam\n'Cause I am whatever you say I am\nIf I wasn't, then why would I say I am?\nIn the paper, the news, every day I am\nHa, I don't know, that's just the way I am\n[Produced by Eminem]257Embed"
