How's your daughter?\nMy girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father\nIf I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her? I'ma name her Bonnie\nI read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry\nI had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him\nI know you prob'ly hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan\nI even got the underground shit that you did with Skam\nI got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man\nI like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat\nAnyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back\nJust to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan\nSee Eminem LiveGet tickets as low as $98You might also like[Chorus: Dido]\nMy tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I\nGot out of bed at all\nThe morning rain clouds up my window (Window)\nAnd I can't see at all\nAnd even if I could, it'd all be grey\nBut your picture on my wall\nIt reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nDear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance\nI ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans\nIf you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to\nBut you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew\nThat's my little brother, man, he's only six years old\nWe waited in the blisterin' cold for you, for four hours, and you just said, \"no\"\nThat's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol\nHe wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do\nI ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to\nRemember when we met in Denver? You said if I'd write you, you would write back\nSee, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither\nHe used to always cheat on my mom and beat her\nI can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs\nSo when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on\n'Cause I don't really got shit else, so that shit helps when I'm depressed\nI even got a tattoo with your name across the chest\nSometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds\nIt's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me\nSee, everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it\nMy girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7\nBut she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does\nShe don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up\nYou gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose\nSincerely yours, Stan\u2014P.S. We should be together too\n[Chorus: Dido]\nMy tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I\nGot out of bed at all\nThe morning rain clouds up my window (Window)\nAnd I can't see at all\nAnd even if I could, it'd all be grey\nBut your picture on my wall\nIt reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nDear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans\nThis'll be the last package I ever send your ass\nIt's been six months, and still no word\u2014I don't deserve it?\nI know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect\nSo this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it\nI'm in the car right now, I'm doin' ninety on the freeway\nHey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?\nYou know the song by Phil Collins, \"In the Air of the Night\"\nAbout that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'\nBut didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?\nThat's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'\nNow it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now\u2014I'm drowsy\nAnd all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call\nI hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall\nI loved you, Slim, we coulda been together\u2014think about it!\nYou ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it\nAnd when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it\nI hope your conscience eats at you, and you can't breathe without me\nSee, Slim\u2014shut up, bitch! I'm tryna talk\nHey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk\nBut I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up\u2014see? I ain't like you\n'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too\nWell, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now\nOh, shit, I forgot\u2014how am I supposed to send this shit out?!\n[Chorus: Dido]\nMy tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I\nGot out of bed at all\nThe morning rain clouds up my window (Window)\nAnd I can't see at all\nAnd even if I could, it'd all be grey\nBut your picture on my wall\nIt reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)\n\n[Verse 4: Eminem]\nDear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy\nYou said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?\nLook, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that\nAnd here's an autograph for your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap\nI'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you\nDon't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you\nBut what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?\nI say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?\nYou got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'\nTo help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some\nAnd what's this shit about us meant to be together?\nThat type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other\nI really think you and your girlfriend need each other\nOr maybe you just need to treat her better\nI hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time\nBefore you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine\nIf you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan\nWhy are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan\nI just don't want you to do some crazy shit\nI seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick\nSome dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge\nAnd had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid\nAnd in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to\nCome to think about it, his name was\u2014it was you\nDamn...672Embed"
