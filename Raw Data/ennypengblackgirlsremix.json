(No)\nWant a fat booty like my aunty got, yo (Ayy)\nWheel up the bloodclart, tell her reload it\nI've got the camera, my girls are posin'\nI need some back up then my ones are rollin'\nGrown woman ting, so I'm never at risk\nMind my own business so I'm never in mess (Uh)\nWho am I? I ain't bait (Oh)\nGet a slice of the cake\nWant a house with a view and a new pair of shoes\nKeep it real from the jump\nGucci gang, Lil Pump\nLittle vibe, little bass, little kick, little snare\nLittle lies, big truths\nDo you, they don't care\nDo you, they don't care\nGet your ass out the box and build up from there\nI don't have a gang with me\nBut I still walk with a gangster lean\nAnd rock Nike's cause we think they're clean\nMJ, leather jacket, beat it, Billie Jean\nMJ, leather jacket 'cause I think I'm bad\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus: ENNY & Jorja Smith, Jorja Smith]\nThat's cool, I like it\nThe growth, the light\nThe pain, the fight\nWe love, we fight\nWe hurt, we cry (No, no)\nHe paid the price\nYou'll be alright\n\n[Chorus: Jorja Smith]\nI think I need some time away\nI took a little time, I prayed\nWe gon' be alright, okay\nAlright, okay\nAlright, okay\nI think I need some time away\nI took a little time, I prayed\nWe gon' be alright, okay\nAlright, okay\nAlright, okay\nAlright, okay\n\n[Verse 2: Jorja Smith]\nENNY said there's peng black girls in our area codes\nThese black girls need to be in the shows\nBe on the runways, not just mood boards\nOn top of that, we gotta see them in your team\nLook at your crown, natural relaxed\nHad a Jheri curl one time, soft and sheen\nWhere black girl magic is sometimes blue\nMight have broke a hair band or two\nRaise my voice, you gonna say that I'm angry\nKiss my teeth and now you say that I'm hood\nKid at sixteen, you say it's my destiny\nDrive a Range, you think I'm up to no good\nGive us a break and let us breathe, man\nGive us a chance, let us achieve, fam\nAnd I know that my hair looks a bit different today\nSo don't touch my hair\n[Verse 3: ENNY]\nLike, new hair, who this?\nOld black bomber jacket and the Bantu twists\nLook, mind over matter, I can handle this\nWe're fine, took a second, the rewards in risk\nSee, I think that I care too much\nBottle of some Courvoisier, two cups\nI've got nothing to show but you love to check my flaws and all my trials\nI was black back when it wasn't even in style\n\n[Pre-Chorus: ENNY & Jorja Smith]\nThat's cool, I like it\nThe growth, the light\nThe pain, the fight\nWe love, we fight\nWe hurt, we cry\nHe paid the price\nYou'll be alright\n\n[Chorus: Jorja Smith]\nI think I need some time away\nI took a little time, I prayed\nWe gon' be alright, okay\nAlright, okay\nAlright, okay\nI think I need some time away\nI took a little time, I prayed\nWe gon' be alright, okay\nAlright, okay\nAlright, okay\nAlright, okay19Embed"
