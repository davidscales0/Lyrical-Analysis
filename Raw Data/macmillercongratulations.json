Okay\nLove\nLove, love, love, love, love (Sex)\nLove, love, love, love, love, love, love (Sex)\n\n[Verse 1: Mac Miller]\nThis sun don't shine when I'm alone\nI lose my mind and I lose control\nI see your eyes look through my soul\nDon't be surprised, this all I know\nI felt the highs and they feel like you\nSee, a love like mine is too good to be true\nAnd you too divine to just be mine\nYou remind me of the color blue\nGirl, I'm so in love with you, yeah\nGirl, I'm so in love with you\nYou might also like[Bridge: Mac Miller]\nYeah\nYeah\nYeah, yeah (Baby)\nYeah, yeah\nUm, well\n\n[Verse 2: Mac Miller]\nBaby, you were everything I ever wanted\nBought a wedding ring, it's in my pocket\nPlanned to ask the other day, knew you'd run away, so I guess I just forgot it\nRemember when you went away to college?\nHours on the phone we end up talkin'\nPast, present, future, all the gossip, goddamn\nPuppy love ain't what it was, darlin'\nFeelings that we have are so alarmin'\nI can make you laugh, I can break the glass\nIf we made it last, it'd be a bargain\nMr. Charmin', that is my department\nYou was there before the fancy cars and\nYou was there when I was just a starvin' artist\nWhen the car was havin' trouble startin'\nNow we got our own apartment, same box for the mail\nSame hamper for the laundry, the food in the fridge is stale\nAnd this mornin', you cooked the eggs with the kale\nI tried to hit it while you was gettin' dressed\nYou said, \"All you ever think about is sex\"\nI'm like, \"Oh well, you know me so well\nAnd if this what make you late, I swear I won't tell\nAnd every time I call your phone, you better pick up your cell\nI swear to God I'ma freak out if it go straight to voice mail\"\nWell, I'm the jealous type, but I swear that ass is what Heaven's like\nAnd when I'm in that pussy, it's a better life\nThat's the only way I'm tryna end the night\nIt's my only chance, I better get it right\n[Chorus: Mac Miller]\nTake your time, my baby\nIt's all waitin' for you, for you\nI know I make your mind go crazy\nBut it's all waitin' right here for you, for you\n\n[Outro: Bilal]\nYou would get close, I would run away\nAll I ever known is the color gray\nYour loving ways bring me sunshine\nI found an angel so divine (So divine)\nHeaven probably not the same without you (Not the same)\nBut now you're in my world (In my world), in my world\nAh, ah, ah, ah29Embed"
