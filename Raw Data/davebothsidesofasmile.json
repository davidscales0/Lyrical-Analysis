leads?\nYou know, I guess we're all just, we're all just, like, looking for a happy ending somewhere\n\n[Pre-Chorus: James Blake]\nHey, it's okay (It's okay)\nI don't care if no one knows my name\nPain, it's all the same (It's all the same)\nEven if you think it's all in vain\n\n[Chorus: James Blake]\n'Cause I am turning hurt\nInto rose, into rose, into rose, oh\nInto rose, into rose, into rose\nHow could we let it slide?\nHm-mm-mm-mm\nLooking back at our lives\nThe future's just a li\u0435\nWe'll be ther\u0435, you and I\nHm-mm-mm-mm\nOn both sides of a smile\n\n[Verse: Dave, ShaSimone, Dave & ShaSimone]\nYeah\nYou keep the bread all to yourself and you get mold from it\nYou give a good girl a rose and you get gold from it\nHave a child with a rat and you'll get a mouse from it\nYou give a woman a brick and you'll get a house from it\nThe first time splittin' up always the hardest thing\nLove's a film and I'm just flickin' through the parts I'm in\nI told her, \"I don't wanna argue in this car I'm in\"\nAnd that's when she hit me with a\n\"Well, I don't get why you would tell me you want me to be your wifey\nWhen you wanna be Romeo, have me here for the rodeo\nI don't believe you when you gas me up and hype me\n'Cause you're lusting and these women you're fuckin' look nothin' like me, David\nYou find asylum in the countries that you fly me\nAnd carry all of your guilt in designers bags that you buy me, David\nI ain't askin' you to be someone you wasn't\"\nI just wanna fuck with the person I fell in love with, but, uh\nPetite waist, sweet face, I'll find another man\nYou must have forgotten who the fuck I am\nThere's plenty niggas waitin' for chances\nAsk me if I'm taken, I say, \"Taken for granted\"\nBut you know this already 'cause we've spoken already\nWant me to wait 'cause you ain't ready, nah, we're both in our twenties\nI'd date a man before I wait for a man, this ends here\n'Cause I'll be damned if I give a fucking loser my best years\nGot my own car, own money and my own body\nIf I show body, this for me, this ain't for nobody\nI'ma change the lock on the door, think I'm a homebody?\nYou won't have a house to fucking live in\n'Cause you taught me you don't listen\nThere's a difference in mistakes and in decisions, David\nThe first time was the worst time\nIt didn't hurt like the second or the third time\nShe put her life on pause\nYou might also like[Chorus: James Blake]\n'Cause I am turning hurt\nInto rose, into rose, into rose, oh\nInto rose, into rose, into rose\nHow could we let it slide?\nHm-mm-mm-mm\nLooking back at our lives\nThe future's just a lie\nWe'll be there, you and I\nHm-mm-mm-mm\nOn both sides of a smile\nHm-mm-mm-mm\n\n[Part II]\n\n[Intro: James Blake & Dave]\nMm-hmm-hmm, mm, mm, mm, mm\nMm-hmm-hmm, mm, mm, mm, mm-mm\n\n[Verse: Dave & James Blake]\nYeah, I just came to the area I grew up in\nAnd they can't even see the car, but from the engine, they know it's me\nFrom no fixed abode to the coast of Greece\nI'm most at home in the places I ain't supposed to be\nI grew up seeing mummy count pennies\nTryna buy a train ticket, but forget sayin', \"Woe is me\"\nNow I'm in L.A. with the open sea\nThey both feel like things I wasn't supposed to see\nUsed to be my pulse, we was close\nNow we argue to the rhythm of a broken beat\nTo the beat of a broken heart\nNapoleon Bonaparte meets Joan of Arc, shh\nWe're both fightin' the sea, this is Noah's ark\nWhere lovers with a broken past, grow apart\nMost things that last have the slowest start\nA lotta pain and a lotta tears\nThe only reason that I lie is 'cause of what I fear\nMy girl knows that I'm a fan of charity\nBut there's some information I ain't ever gonna volunteer\nI wish that I could pay for my sins with a lump sum\nRestore her belief in me with a trust fund\nThe money can't buy nothing when the love's done\nI used to cheat with Americans for a living\nI felt nervous every time I got a call from a plus one\nIt takes years to build when you love one\nTwo and half minutes and it's undone\nBought my girl a Birkin and she told me that these bitches can't chat to her, I'm tellin' her that they never could\nYou know you love her when you're doin' shit you never would\nCome up off the drugs and bank scams\nHow the fuck you think I got the name Santan?\nRun up on me and get a skin tan\nOnly when you're gone, they feel your impact\nNineteen, I had dreams of a wedding ring\nSo focused on running our race\nYou can ask James Blake, I ain't see the colour in anything\nAnd then the world got darker than it's ever been\nReal estate, I buss a smile\nInternational, that's how I'm comin' now\nMortgage on the yard like twenty-two hundred\nBut the rent's got it covered by a country mile\nFeels like my luck's been runnin' out, tsh\nIt feels like my luck's been runnin' out\nFeels like my luck's been runnin' out, tsh\nIt feels like my luck's been runnin' out\n[Outro: James Blake & Dave]\nMm-hmm-hmm, mm, mm, mm, mm-mm\nMm-hmm-hmm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm-mm\nMm-hmm-hmm, mm, mm, mm, mm-mm\nIt feels like my luck's been runnin' out, tsh\nMm-hmm-hmm, mm, mm, mm, mm\nIt feels like my luck's been runnin' out, tsh\nMm-hmm-hmm, mm, mm, mm, mm-mm\nIt feels like my luck's been runnin' out\nMm-hmm-hmm, mm, mm, mm, mm (It feels like my luck's\u2014)\nIt feels like my luck's been runnin' out\nMm-hmm-hmm, mm, mm, mm, mm-mm\nHm, mm, mm, mm, mm\nMm-hmm-hmm, mm, mm, mm, mm-mm11Embed"
