Blue skies from pain?\nCan you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?\nA smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?\n\n[Verse 2]\nDid they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?\nHot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?\nCold comfort for change? Did you exchange\nA walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus]\nHow I wish, how I wish you were here\nWe're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl, year after year\nRunning over the same old ground, what have we found?\nThe same old fears, wish you were here\nYou might also like[Instrumental Outro]215Embed"
