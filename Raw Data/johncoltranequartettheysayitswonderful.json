Be pfrwritt.\n\nDone.\n\nBegin!\n\nBronze by gold, miss Douce's head by miss Kennedy's head, over the crossblind of the Ormond bar heard the viceregal hoofs go by, ringing steel.\n\n\u2014Is that her? asked miss Kennedy.\n\nMiss Douce said yes, sitting with his ex, pearl grey and eau de Nil.\n\u2014Exquisite contrast, miss Kennedy said.\n\nWhen all agog miss Douce said eagerly:\n\n\u2014Look at the fellow in the tall silk.\n\n\u2014Who? Where? gold asked more eagerly.\n\n\u2014In the second carriage, miss Douce's wet lips said, laughing in the sun.\n\nHe's looking. Mind till I see.\n\nShe darted, bronze, to the backmost corner, flattening her face against the pane in a halo of hurried breath.\n\nHer wet lips tittered:\n\n\u2014He's killed looking back.\n\nShe laughed:\n\n\u2014O wept! Aren't men frightful idiots?\n\nWith sadness.\n\nMiss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair behind an ear. Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a hair.\n\nSadly she twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear.\n\n\u2014It's them has the fine times, sadly then she said.\n\nA man.\nBloowho went by by Moulang's pipes bearing in his breast the sweets of sin, by Wine's antiques, in memory bearing sweet sinful words, by Carroll's dusky battered plate, for Raoul.\nThe boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came. For them unheeding him he banged on the counter his tray of chattering china. And\n\n\u2014There's your teas, he said.\n\nMiss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned lithia crate, safe from eyes, low.\n\n\u2014What is it? loud boots unmannerly asked.\n\n\u2014Find out, miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.\n\n\u2014Your beau, is it?\n\nA haughty bronze replied:\n\n\u2014I'll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your impertinent insolence.\n\n\u2014Imperthnthn thnthnthn, bootssnout sniffed rudely, as he retreated as she threatened as he had come.\n\nBloom.\n\nOn her flower frowning miss Douce said:\n\n\u2014Most aggravating that young brat is. If he doesn't conduct himself I'll wring his ear for him a yard long.\n\nLadylike in exquisite contrast.\n\n\u2014Take no notice, miss Kennedy rejoined.\n\nShe poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea. They cowered under their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned, waiting for their teas to draw. They pawed their blouses, both of black satin, two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and seven.\nYes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear, hoofs ring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel.\n\n\u2014Am I awfully sunburnt?\n\nMiss bronze unbloused her neck.\n\n\u2014No, said miss Kennedy. It gets brown after. Did you try the borax with the cherry laurel water?\n\nMiss Douce halfstood to see her skin askance in the barmirror gildedlettered where hock and claret glasses shimmered and in their midst a shell.\n\n\u2014And leave it to my hands, she said.\n\n\u2014Try it with the glycerine, miss Kennedy advised.\n\nBidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce\n\n\u2014Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated. I asked that old fogey in Boyd's for something for my skin.\n\nMiss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed:\n\n\u2014O, don't remind me of him for mercy' sake!\n\n\u2014But wait till I tell you, miss Douce entreated.\n\nSweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears with little fingers.\n\n\u2014No, don't, she cried.\n\n\u2014I won't listen, she cried.\n\nBut Bloom?\n\nMiss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey's tone:\n\n\u2014For your what? says he.\n\nMiss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed again:\n\n\u2014Don't let me think of him or I'll expire. The hideous old wretch! That night in the Antient Concert Rooms.\n\nShe sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea.\n\n\u2014Here he was, miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters, ruffling her nosewings. Hufa! Hufa!\n\nShrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy's throat. Miss Douce huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a snout in quest.\n\n\u2014O! shrieking, miss Kennedy cried. Will you ever forget his goggle eye?\n\nMiss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting:\n\n\u2014And your other eye!\n\nBloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner's name. Why do I always think Figather? Gathering figs, I think. And Prosper Lore's huguenot name. By Bassi's blessed virgins Bloom's dark eyes went by. Bluerobed, white under, come to me. God they believe she is: or goddess. Those today. I could not see. That fellow spoke. A student. After with Dedalus' son. He might be Mulligan. All comely virgins. That brings those rakes of fellows in: her white.\n\nBy went his eyes. The sweets of sin. Sweet are the sweets.\n\nOf sin.\n\nIn a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy your other eye. They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other, high piercing notes.\n\nAh, panting, sighing, sighing, ah, fordone, their mirth died down.\n\nMiss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and gigglegiggled. Miss Douce, bending over the teatray, ruffled again her nose and rolled droll fattened eyes. Again Kennygiggles, stooping, her fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed, spluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter, coughing with choking, crying:\n\n\u2014O greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that! she cried. With his bit of beard!\n\nDouce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman, delight, joy, indignation.\n\n\u2014Married to the greasy nose! she yelled.\n\nShrill, with deep laughter, after, gold after bronze, they urged each each to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold, goldbronze, shrilldeep, to laughter after laughter. And then laughed more. Greasy I knows. Exhausted, breathless, their shaken heads they laid, braided and pinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge. All flushed (O!), panting, sweating (O!), all breathless.\n\nMarried to Bloom, to greaseabloom.\n\n\u2014O saints above! miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose. I wished\n\nI hadn't laughed so much. I feel all wet.\n\n\u2014O, miss Douce! miss Kennedy protested. You horrid thing!\n\nAnd flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.\n\nBy Cantwell's offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi's virgins, bright of their oils. Nannetti's father hawked those things about, wheedling at doors as I. Religion pays. Must see him for that par. Eat first. I want. Not yet. At four, she said. Time ever passing. Clockhands turning. On. Where eat? The Clarence, Dolphin. On. For Raoul. Eat. If I net five guineas with those ads. The violet silk petticoats. Not yet. The sweets of sin.\n\nFlushed less, still less, goldenly paled.\n\nInto their bar strolled Mr Dedalus. Chips, picking chips off one of his rocky thumbnails. Chips. He strolled.\n\n\u2014O, welcome back, miss Douce.\n\nHe held her hand. Enjoyed her holidays?\n\n\u2014Tiptop.\n\nHe hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor.\n\n\u2014Gorgeous, she said. Look at the holy show I am. Lying out on the strand all day.\n\nBronze whiteness.\n\n\u2014That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her and pressed her hand indulgently. Tempting poor simple males.\n\nMiss Douce of satin douced her arm away.\n\n\u2014O go away! she said. You're very simple, I don't think.\n\nHe was.\n\n\u2014Well now I am, he mused. I looked so simple in the cradle they christened me simple Simon.\n\n\u2014You must have been a doaty, miss Douce made answer. And what did the doctor order today?\n\n\u2014Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself. I think I'll trouble you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.\n\nJingle.\n\n\u2014With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.\n\nWith grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane's she turned herself. With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from her crystal keg. Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought pouch and pipe. Alacrity she served. He blew through the flue two husky fifenotes.\n\n\u2014By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains. Must be a great tonic in the air down there. But a long threatening comes at last, they say. Yes. Yes.\n\nYes. He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid's, into the bowl. Chips. Shreds. Musing. Mute.\n\nNone nought said nothing. Yes.\n\nGaily miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling:\n\n\u2014O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas!\n\n\u2014Was Mr Lidwell in today?\n\nIn came Lenehan. Round him peered Lenehan. Mr Bloom reached Essex bridge. Yes, Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex. To Martha I must write. Buy paper. Daly's. Girl there civil. Bloom. Old Bloom. Blue bloom is on the rye.\n\n\u2014He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said.\n\nLenehan came forward.\n\n\u2014Was Mr Boylan looking for me?\n\nHe asked. She answered:\n\n\u2014Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?\n\nShe asked. Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her gaze upon a page:\n\n\u2014No. He was not.\n\nMiss gaze of Kennedy, heard, not seen, read on. Lenehan round the sandwichbell wound his round body round.\n\n\u2014Peep! Who's in the corner?\n\nNo glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures. To mind her stops. To read only the black ones: round o and crooked ess.\n\nJingle jaunty jingle.\n\nGirlgold she read and did not glance. Take no notice. She took no notice while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly:\n\n\u2014Ah fox met ah stork. Said thee fox too thee stork: Will you put your bill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone?\n\nHe droned in vain. Miss Douce turned to her tea aside.\n\nHe sighed aside:\n\n\u2014Ah me! O my!\n\nHe greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.\n\n\u2014Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.\n\n\u2014Who may he be? Mr Dedalus asked.\n\nLenehan opened most genial arms. Who?\n\n\u2014Who may he be? he asked. Can you ask? Stephen, the youthful bard.\n\nDry.\n\nMr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe.\n\n\u2014I see, he said. I didn't recognise him for the moment. I hear he is keeping very select company. Have you seen him lately?\n\nHe had.\n\n\u2014I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan. In Mooney's en ville and in Mooney's sur mer. He had received the rhino for the labour of his muse.\n\nHe smiled at bronze's teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes:\n\n\u2014The \u00e9lite of Erin hung upon his lips. The ponderous pundit, Hugh\n\nMacHugh, Dublin's most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel boy of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of the O'Madden Burke.\n\nAfter an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and\n\n\u2014That must have been highly diverting, said he. I see.\n\nHe see. He drank. With faraway mourning mountain eye. Set down his glass.\n\nHe looked towards the saloon door.\n\n\u2014I see you have moved the piano.\n\n\u2014The tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking concert and I never heard such an exquisite player.\n\n\u2014Is that a fact?\n\n\u2014Didn't he, miss Kennedy? The real classical, you know. And blind too, poor fellow. Not twenty I'm sure he was.\n\n\u2014Is that a fact? Mr Dedalus said.\n\nHe drank and strayed away.\n\n\u2014So sad to look at his face, miss Douce condoled.\n\nGod's curse on bitch's bastard.\n\nTink to her pity cried a diner's bell. To the door of the bar and diningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of Ormond. Lager for diner. Lager without alacrity she served.\n\nWith patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for jinglejaunty blazes boy.\n\nUpholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the oblique triple (piano!) wires. He pressed (the same who pressed indulgently her hand), soft pedalling, a triple of keys to see the thicknesses of felt advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in action.\n\nTwo sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was in Wisdom Hely's wise Bloom in Daly's Henry Flower bought. Are you not happy in your home? Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo. Means something, language of flow. Was it a daisy? Innocence that is. Respectable girl meet after mass. Thanks awfully muchly. Wise Bloom eyed on the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves. Smoke mermaids, coolest whiff of all. Hair streaming: lovelorn. For some man. For Raoul. He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat riding on a jaunting car. It is. Again. Third time. Coincidence.\n\nJingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay. Follow. Risk it. Go quick. At four. Near now. Out.\n\n\u2014Twopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say.\n\n\u2014Aha... I was forgetting... Excuse...\n\n\u2014And four.\n\nAt four she. Winsomely she on Bloohimwhom smiled. Bloo smi qui go. Ternoon. Think you're the only pebble on the beach? Does that to all.\n\nFor men.\n\nIn drowsy silence gold bent on her page.\n\nFrom the saloon a call came, long in dying. That was a tuningfork the tuner had that he forgot that he now struck. A call again. That he now poised that it now throbbed. You hear? It throbbed, pure, purer, softly and softlier, its buzzing prongs. Longer in dying call.\n\nPat paid for diner's popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray and popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with miss\n\nDouce.\n\n\u2014The bright stars fade...\n\nA voiceless song sang from within, singing:\n\n\u2014... the morn is breaking.\n\nA duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive hands. Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording, called to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love's leavetaking, life's, love's morn.\n\n\u2014The dewdrops pearl...\n\nLenehan's lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy.\n\n\u2014But look this way, he said, rose of Castile.\n\nJingle jaunted by the curb and stopped.\n\nShe rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile: fretted, forlorn, dreamily rose.\n\n\u2014Did she fall or was she pushed? he asked her.\n\nShe answered, slighting:\n\n\u2014Ask no questions and you'll hear no lies.\n\nLike lady, ladylike.\n\nBlazes Boylan's smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he strode. Yes, gold from anear by bronze from afar. Lenehan heard and knew and hailed him:\n\n\u2014See the conquering hero comes.\n\nBetween the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered hero. See me he might. The seat he sat on: warm. Black wary hecat walked towards Richie Goulding's legal bag, lifted aloft, saluting.\n\n\u2014And I from thee...\n\n\u2014I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.\n\nHe touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw. She smiled on him. But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer hair, a bosom and a rose.\n\nSmart Boylan bespoke potions.\n\n\u2014What's your cry? Glass of bitter? Glass of bitter, please, and a sloegin for me. Wire in yet?\n\nNot yet. At four she. Who said four?\n\nCowley's red lugs and bulging apple in the door of the sheriff's office.\n\nAvoid. Goulding a chance. What is he doing in the Ormond? Car waiting.\n\nWait.\n\nHello. Where off to? Something to eat? I too was just. In here. What, Ormond? Best value in Dublin. Is that so? Diningroom. Sit tight there. See, not be seen. I think I'll join you. Come on. Richie led on. Bloom followed bag. Dinner fit for a prince.\n\nMiss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her bust, that all but burst, so high.\n\n\u2014O! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch. O!\nBut easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.\n\n\u2014Why don't you grow? asked Blazes Boylan.\n\nShebronze, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his lips, looked as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), and syrupped with her voice:\n\n\u2014Fine goods in small parcels.\n\nThat is to say she. Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe.\n\n\u2014Here's fortune, Blazes said.\n\nHe pitched a broad coin down. Coin rang.\n\n\u2014Hold on, said Lenehan, till I...\n\n\u2014Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale.\n\n\u2014Sceptre will win in a canter, he said.\n\n\u2014I plunged a bit, said Boylan winking and drinking. Not on my own, you know. Fancy of a friend of mine.\n\nLenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at miss Douce's lips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled.\n\nIdolores. The eastern seas.\n\nClock whirred. Miss Kennedy passed their way (flower, wonder who gave), bearing away teatray. Clock clacked.\n\nMiss Douce took Boylan's coin, struck boldly the cashregister. It clanged. Clock clacked. Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till and hummed and handed coins in change. Look to the west. A clack. For me.\n\n\u2014What time is that? asked Blazes Boylan. Four?\n\nO'clock.\n\nLenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged Blazes Boylan's elbowsleeve.\n\n\u2014Let's hear the time, he said.\n\nThe bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered tables. Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table near the door. Be near. At four. Has he forgotten? Perhaps a trick. Not come: whet appetite. I couldn't do. Wait, wait. Pat, waiter, waited.\n\nSparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure's skyblue bow and eyes.\n\n\u2014Go on, pressed Lenehan. There's no-one. He never heard.\n\n\u2014... to Flora's lips did hie.\n\nHigh, a high note pealed in the treble clear.\n\nBronzedouce communing with her rose that sank and rose sought\n\nBlazes Boylan's flower and eyes.\n\n\u2014Please, please.\n\nHe pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.\n\n\u2014I could not leave thee...\n\n\u2014Afterwits, miss Douce promised coyly.\n\n\u2014No, now, urged Lenehan. Sonnezlacloche! O do! There's no-one.\n\nShe looked. Quick. Miss Kenn out of earshot. Sudden bent. Two kindling faces watched her bend.\n\nQuavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord, and lost and found it, faltering.\n\n\u2014Go on! Do! Sonnez!\n\nBending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee. Delayed. Taunted them still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes.\n\n\u2014Sonnez!\n\nSmack. She set free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter smackwarm against her smackable a woman's warmhosed thigh.\n\n\u2014La Cloche! cried gleeful Lenehan. Trained by owner. No sawdust there.\n\nShe smilesmirked supercilious (wept! aren't men?), but, lightward gliding, mild she smiled on Boylan.\n\n\u2014You're the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said.\n\nBoylan, eyed, eyed. Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his chalice tiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops. His spellbound eyes went after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by mirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses shimmering, a spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with sunnier bronze.\n\nYes, bronze from anearby.\n\n\u2014... Sweetheart, goodbye!\n\n\u2014I'm off, said Boylan with impatience.\n\nHe slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.\n\n\u2014Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly. I wanted to tell you.\n\nTom Rochford...\n\n\u2014Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.\n\nLenehan gulped to go.\n\n\u2014Got the horn or what? he said. Wait. I'm coming.\n\nHe followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the threshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.\n\n\u2014How do you do, Mr Dollard?\n\n\u2014Eh? How do? How do? Ben Dollard's vague bass answered, turning an instant from Father Cowley's woe. He won't give you any trouble, Bob. Alf Bergan will speak to the long fellow. We'll put a barleystraw in that Judas Iscariot's ear this time.\n\nSighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an eyelid.\n\n\u2014Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily. Come on, Simon. Give us a ditty. We heard the piano.\n\nBald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders. Power for Richie. And Bloom? Let me see. Not make him walk twice. His corns. Four now. How warm this black is. Course nerves a bit. Refracts (is it?) heat. Let me see. Cider. Yes, bottle of cider.\n\n\u2014What's that? Mr Dedalus said. I was only vamping, man.\n\n\u2014Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called. Begone dull care. Come, Bob.\n\nHe ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the: hold him now) into the saloon. He plumped him Dollard on the stool. His gouty paws plumped chords. Plumped, stopped abrupt.\n\nBald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning. Bothered, he wanted Power and cider. Bronze by the window, watched, bronze from afar.\n\nJingle a tinkle jaunted.\n\nBloom heard a jing, a little sound. He's off. Light sob of breath Bloom sighed on the silent bluehued flowers. Jingling. He's gone. Jingle. Hear.\n\n\u2014Love and War, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. God be with old times.\n\nMiss Douce's brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind, smitten by sunlight. Gone. Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting light), she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord. She drew down pensive (why did he go so quick when I?) about her bronze, over the bar where bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast inexquisite nonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of shadow, eau de Nil.\n\n\u2014Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded them. There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the Collard grand.\n\nThere was.\n\n\u2014A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said. The devil wouldn't stop him. He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.\n\n\u2014God, do you remember? Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the punished keyboard. And by Japers I had no wedding garment.\n\nThey laughed all three. He had no wed. All trio laughed. No wedding garment.\n\n\u2014Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said. Where's my pipe, by the way?\n\nHe wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe. Bald Pat carried two diners' drinks, Richie and Poldy. And Father Cowley laughed again.\n\n\u2014I saved the situation, Ben, I think.\n\n\u2014You did, averred Ben Dollard. I remember those tight trousers too. That was a brilliant idea, Bob.\n\nFather Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes. He saved the situa. Tight trou. Brilliant ide.\n\n\u2014I knew he was on the rocks, he said. The wife was playing the piano in the coffee palace on Saturdays for a very trifling consideration and who was it gave me the wheeze she was doing the other business? Do you remember? We had to search all Holles street to find them till the chap in Keogh's gave us the number. Remember? Ben remembered, his broad visage wondering.\n\n\u2014By God, she had some luxurious operacloaks and things there.\n\nMr Dedalus wandered back, pipe in hand.\n\n\u2014Merrion square style. Balldresses, by God, and court dresses. He wouldn't take any money either. What? Any God's quantity of cocked hats and boleros and trunkhose. What?\n\n\u2014Ay, ay, Mr Dedalus nodded. Mrs Marion Bloom has left off clothes of all descriptions.\n\nJingle jaunted down the quays. Blazes sprawled on bounding tyres.\n\nLiver and bacon. Steak and kidney pie. Right, sir. Right, Pat.\n\nMrs Marion. Met him pike hoses. Smell of burn. Of Paul de Kock. Nice name he.\n\n\u2014What's this her name was? A buxom lassy. Marion...\n\n\u2014Tweedy.\n\n\u2014Yes. Is she alive?\n\n\u2014And kicking.\n\n\u2014She was a daughter of...\n\n\u2014Daughter of the regiment.\n\n\u2014Yes, begad. I remember the old drummajor.\n\nMr Dedalus struck, whizzed, lit, puffed savoury puff after\n\n\u2014Irish? I don't know, faith. Is she, Simon?\n\nPuff after stiff, a puff, strong, savoury, crackling.\n\n\u2014Buccinator muscle is... What?... Bit rusty... O, she is... My Irish Molly, O.\n\nHe puffed a pungent plumy blast.\n\n\u2014From the rock of Gibraltar... all the way.\n\nThey pined in depth of ocean shadow, gold by the beerpull, bronze by maraschino, thoughtful all two. Mina Kennedy, 4 Lismore terrace, Drumcondra with Idolores, a queen, Dolores, silent.\n\nPat served, uncovered dishes. Leopold cut liverslices. As said before he ate with relish the inner organs, nutty gizzards, fried cods' roes while Richie Goulding, Collis, Ward ate steak and kidney, steak then kidney, bite by bite of pie he ate Bloom ate they ate.\n\nBloom with Goulding, married in silence, ate. Dinners fit for princes.\n\nBy Bachelor's walk jogjaunty jingled Blazes Boylan, bachelor, in sun in heat, mare's glossy rump atrot, with flick of whip, on bounding tyres: sprawled, warmseated, Boylan impatience, ardentbold. Horn. Have you the? Horn. Have you the? Haw haw horn.\n\nOver their voices Dollard bassooned attack, booming over bombarding chords:\n\n\u2014When love absorbs my ardent soul...\n\nRoll of Bensoulbenjamin rolled to the quivery loveshivery roofpanes.\n\n\u2014War! War! cried Father Cowley. You're the warrior.\n\n\u2014So I am, Ben Warrior laughed. I was thinking of your landlord. Love or money.\n\nHe stopped. He wagged huge beard, huge face over his blunder huge.\n\n\u2014Sure, you'd burst the tympanum of her ear, man, Mr Dedalus said through smoke aroma, with an organ like yours.\n\nIn bearded abundant laughter Dollard shook upon the keyboard. He would.\n\n\u2014Not to mention another membrane, Father Cowley added. Half time, Ben. Amoroso ma non troppo. Let me there.\n\nMiss Kennedy served two gentlemen with tankards of cool stout. She passed a remark. It was indeed, first gentleman said, beautiful weather. They drank cool stout. Did she know where the lord lieutenant was going? And heard steelhoofs ringhoof ring. No, she couldn't say. But it would be in the paper. O, she need not trouble. No trouble. She waved about her outspread Independent, searching, the lord lieutenant, her pinnacles of hair slowmoving, lord lieuten. Too much trouble, first gentleman said. O, not in the least. Way he looked that. Lord lieutenant. Gold by bronze heard iron steel.\n\n\u2014............ my ardent soul\nI care not foror the morrow.\n\nIn liver gravy Bloom mashed mashed potatoes. Love and War someone is. Ben Dollard's famous. Night he ran round to us to borrow a dress suit for that concert. Trousers tight as a drum on him. Musical porkers. Molly did laugh when he went out. Threw herself back across the bed, screaming, kicking. With all his belongings on show. O saints above, I'm drenched! O, the women in the front row! O, I never laughed so many! Well, of course that's what gives him the base barreltone. For instance eunuchs. Wonder who's playing. Nice touch. Must be Cowley. Musical. Knows whatever note you play. Bad breath he has, poor chap. Stopped.\n\nMiss Douce, engaging, Lydia Douce, bowed to suave solicitor, George Lidwell, gentleman, entering. Good afternoon. She gave her moist (a lady's) hand to his firm clasp. Afternoon. Yes, she was back. To the old dingdong again.\n\n\u2014Your friends are inside, Mr Lidwell.\n\nGeorge Lidwell, suave, solicited, held a lydiahand.\n\nBloom ate liv as said before. Clean here at least. That chap in the Burton, gummy with gristle. No-one here: Goulding and I. Clean tables, flowers, mitres of napkins. Pat to and fro. Bald Pat. Nothing to do. Best value in Dub.\n\nPiano again. Cowley it is. Way he sits in to it, like one together, mutual understanding. Tiresome shapers scraping fiddles, eye on the bowend, sawing the cello, remind you of toothache. Her high long snore. Night we were in the box. Trombone under blowing like a grampus, between the acts, other brass chap unscrewing, emptying spittle. Conductor's legs too, bagstrousers, jiggedy jiggedy. Do right to hide them.\n\nJiggedy jingle jaunty jaunty.\n\nOnly the harp. Lovely. Gold glowering light. Girl touched it. Poop of a lovely. Gravy's rather good fit for a. Golden ship. Erin. The harp that once or twice. Cool hands. Ben Howth, the rhododendrons. We are their harps. I. He. Old. Young.\n\n\u2014Ah, I couldn't, man, Mr Dedalus said, shy, listless.\n\nStrongly.\n\n\u2014Go on, blast you! Ben Dollard growled. Get it out in bits.\n\n\u2014M'appari, Simon, Father Cowley said.\n\nDown stage he strode some paces, grave, tall in affliction, his long arms outheld. Hoarsely the apple of his throat hoarsed softly. Softly he sang to a dusty seascape there: A Last Farewell. A headland, a ship, a sail upon the billows. Farewell. A lovely girl, her veil awave upon the wind upon the headland, wind around her.\n\nCowley sang:\n\n\u2014M'appari tutt'amor:\nIl mio sguardo l'incontr...\n\nShe waved, unhearing Cowley, her veil, to one departing, dear one, to wind, love, speeding sail, return.\n\n\u2014Go on, Simon.\n\n\u2014Ah, sure, my dancing days are done, Ben... Well...\n\nMr Dedalus laid his pipe to rest beside the tuningfork and, sitting, touched the obedient keys.\n\n\u2014No, Simon, Father Cowley turned. Play it in the original. One flat.\n\nThe keys, obedient, rose higher, told, faltered, confessed, confused.\n\nUp stage strode Father Cowley.\n\n\u2014Here, Simon, I'll accompany you, he said. Get up.\n\nBy Graham Lemon's pineapple rock, by Elvery's elephant jingly jogged. Steak, kidney, liver, mashed, at meat fit for princes sat princes Bloom and Goulding. Princes at meat they raised and drank, Power and cider.\n\nMost beautiful tenor air ever written, Richie said: Sonnambula. He heard Joe Maas sing that one night. Ah, what M'Guckin! Yes. In his way. Choirboy style. Maas was the boy. Massboy. A lyrical tenor if you like. Never forget it. Never.\n\nTenderly Bloom over liverless bacon saw the tightened features strain. Backache he. Bright's bright eye. Next item on the programme. Paying the piper. Pills, pounded bread, worth a guinea a box. Stave it off awhile. Sings too: Down among the dead men. Appropriate. Kidney pie. Sweets to the. Not making much hand of it. Best value in. Characteristic of him. Power. Particular about his drink. Flaw in the glass, fresh Vartry water. Fecking matches from counters to save. Then squander a sovereign in dribs and drabs. And when he's wanted not a farthing. Screwed refusing to pay his fare. Curious types.\n\nNever would Richie forget that night. As long as he lived: never. In the gods of the old Royal with little Peake. And when the first note.\n\nSpeech paused on Richie's lips.\n\nComing out with a whopper now. Rhapsodies about damn all.\n\nBelieves his own lies. Does really. Wonderful liar. But want a good memory.\n\n\u2014Which air is that? asked Leopold Bloom.\n\n\u2014All is lost now.\n\nRichie cocked his lips apout. A low incipient note sweet banshee murmured: all. A thrush. A throstle. His breath, birdsweet, good teeth he's proud of, fluted with plaintive woe. Is lost. Rich sound. Two notes in one there. Blackbird I heard in the hawthorn valley. Taking my motives he twined and turned them. All most too new call is lost in all. Echo. How sweet the answer. How is that done? All lost now. Mournful he whistled. Fall, surrender, lost.\n\nBloom bent leopold ear, turning a fringe of doyley down under the vase. Order. Yes, I remember. Lovely air. In sleep she went to him. Innocence in the moon. Brave. Don't know their danger. Still hold her back. Call name. Touch water. Jingle jaunty. Too late. She longed to go. That's why. Woman. As easy stop the sea. Yes: all is lost.\n\n\u2014A beautiful air, said Bloom lost Leopold. I know it well.\n\nNever in all his life had Richie Goulding.\n\nHe knows it well too. Or he feels. Still harping on his daughter. Wise child that knows her father, Dedalus said. Me?\n\nBloom askance over liverless saw. Face of the all is lost. Rollicking Richie once. Jokes old stale now. Wagging his ear. Napkinring in his eye. Now begging letters he sends his son with. Crosseyed Walter sir I did sir. Wouldn't trouble only I was expecting some money. Apologise.\n\nPiano again. Sounds better than last time I heard. Tuned probably. Stopped again.\n\nDollard and Cowley still urged the lingering singer out with it.\n\n\u2014With it, Simon.\n\n\u2014It, Simon.\n\n\u2014Ladies and gentlemen, I am most deeply obliged by your kind solicitations.\n\n\u2014It, Simon.\n\n\u2014I have no money but if you will lend me your attention I shall endeavour to sing to you of a heart bowed down.\n\nBy the sandwichbell in screening shadow Lydia, her bronze and rose, a lady's grace, gave and withheld: as in cool glaucous eau de Nil Mina to tankards two her pinnacles of gold.\n\nThe harping chords of prelude closed. A chord, longdrawn, expectant, drew a voice away.\n\n\u2014When first I saw that form endearing...\n\nRichie turned.\n\n\u2014Si Dedalus' voice, he said.\n\nBraintipped, cheek touched with flame, they listened feeling that flow endearing flow over skin limbs human heart soul spine. Bloom signed to Pat, bald Pat is a waiter hard of hearing, to set ajar the door of the bar. The door of the bar. So. That will do. Pat, waiter, waited, waiting to hear, for he was hard of hear by the door.\n\n\u2014Sorrow from me seemed to depart.\n\nThrough the hush of air a voice sang to them, low, not rain, not leaves in murmur, like no voice of strings or reeds or whatdoyoucallthem dulcimers touching their still ears with words, still hearts of their each his remembered lives. Good, good to hear: sorrow from them each seemed to from both depart when first they heard. When first they saw, lost Richie Poldy, mercy of beauty, heard from a person wouldn't expect it in the least, her first merciful lovesoft oftloved word.\n\nLove that is singing: love's old sweet song. Bloom unwound slowly the elastic band of his packet. Love's old sweet sonnez la gold. Bloom wound a skein round four forkfingers, stretched it, relaxed, and wound it round his troubled double, fourfold, in octave, gyved them fast.\n\n\u2014Full of hope and all delighted...\n\nTenors get women by the score. Increase their flow. Throw flower at his feet. When will we meet? My head it simply. Jingle all delighted. He can't sing for tall hats. Your head it simply swurls. Perfumed for him. What perfume does your wife? I want to know. Jing. Stop. Knock. Last look at mirror always before she answers the door. The hall. There? How do you? I do well. There? What? Or? Phial of cachous, kissing comfits, in her satchel. Yes? Hands felt for the opulent.\n\nAlas the voice rose, sighing, changed: loud, full, shining, proud.\n\n\u2014But alas, 'twas idle dreaming...\n\nGlorious tone he has still. Cork air softer also their brogue. Silly man! Could have made oceans of money. Singing wrong words. Wore out his wife: now sings. But hard to tell. Only the two themselves. If he doesn't break down. Keep a trot for the avenue. His hands and feet sing too. Drink. Nerves overstrung. Must be abstemious to sing. Jenny Lind soup: stock, sage, raw eggs, half pint of cream. For creamy dreamy.\n\nTenderness it welled: slow, swelling, full it throbbed. That's the chat. Ha, give! Take! Throb, a throb, a pulsing proud erect.\n\nWords? Music? No: it's what's behind.\n\nBloom looped, unlooped, noded, disnoded.\n\nBloom. Flood of warm jamjam lickitup secretness flowed to flow in music out, in desire, dark to lick flow invading. Tipping her tepping her tapping her topping her. Tup. Pores to dilate dilating. Tup. The joy the feel the warm the. Tup. To pour o'er sluices pouring gushes. Flood, gush, flow, joygush, tupthrob. Now! Language of love.\n\n\u2014... ray of hope is...\n\nBeaming. Lydia for Lidwell squeak scarcely hear so ladylike the muse unsqueaked a ray of hopk.\n\nMartha it is. Coincidence. Just going to write. Lionel's song. Lovely name you have. Can't write. Accept my little pres. Play on her heartstrings pursestrings too. She's a. I called you naughty boy. Still the name: Martha. How strange! Today.\n\nThe voice of Lionel returned, weaker but unwearied. It sang again to Richie Poldy Lydia Lidwell also sang to Pat open mouth ear waiting to wait. How first he saw that form endearing, how sorrow seemed to part, how look, form, word charmed him Gould Lidwell, won Pat Bloom's heart.\n\nWish I could see his face, though. Explain better. Why the barber in Drago's always looked my face when I spoke his face in the glass. Still hear it better here than in the bar though farther.\n\n\u2014Each graceful look...\n\nFirst night when first I saw her at Mat Dillon's in Terenure. Yellow, black lace she wore. Musical chairs. We two the last. Fate. After her. Fate.\n\nRound and round slow. Quick round. We two. All looked. Halt. Down she sat. All ousted looked. Lips laughing. Yellow knees.\n\n\u2014Charmed my eye...\n\nSinging. Waiting she sang. I turned her music. Full voice of perfume of what perfume does your lilactrees. Bosom I saw, both full, throat warbling. First I saw. She thanked me. Why did she me? Fate. Spanishy eyes. Under a peartree alone patio this hour in old Madrid one side in shadow Dolores shedolores. At me. Luring. Ah, alluring.\n\n\u2014Martha! Ah, Martha!\n\nQuitting all languor Lionel cried in grief, in cry of passion dominant to love to return with deepening yet with rising chords of harmony. In cry of lionel loneliness that she should know, must martha feel. For only her he waited. Where? Here there try there here all try where. Somewhere.\n\n\u2014Co-ome, thou lost one!\nCo-ome, thou dear one!\n\nAlone. One love. One hope. One comfort me. Martha, chestnote, return!\n\n\u2014Come!\n\nIt soared, a bird, it held its flight, a swift pure cry, soar silver orb it leaped serene, speeding, sustained, to come, don't spin it out too long long breath he breath long life, soaring high, high resplendent, aflame, crowned, high in the effulgence symbolistic, high, of the etherial bosom, high, of the high vast irradiation everywhere all soaring all around about the all, the endlessnessnessness...\n\n\u2014To me!\n\nSiopold!\n\nConsumed.\n\nCome. Well sung. All clapped. She ought to. Come. To me, to him, to her, you too, me, us.\n\n\u2014Bravo! Clapclap. Good man, Simon. Clappyclapclap. Encore! Clapclipclap clap. Sound as a bell. Bravo, Simon! Clapclopclap. Encore, enclap, said, cried, clapped all, Ben Dollard, Lydia Douce, George Lidwell, Pat, Mina Kennedy, two gentlemen with two tankards, Cowley, first gent with tank and bronze miss Douce and gold MJiss Mina.\n\nBlazes Boylan's smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor, said before. Jingle by monuments of sir John Gray, Horatio onehandled Nelson, reverend father Theobald Mathew, jaunted, as said before just now. Atrot, in heat, heatseated. Cloche. Sonnez la. Cloche. Sonnez la. Slower the mare went up the hill by the Rotunda, Rutland square. Too slow for Boylan, blazes Boylan, impatience Boylan, joggled the mare.\n\nAn afterclang of Cowley's chords closed, died on the air made richer.\n\nAnd Richie Goulding drank his Power and Leopold Bloom his cider drank, Lidwell his Guinness, second gentleman said they would partake of two more tankards if she did not mind. Miss Kennedy smirked, disserving, coral lips, at first, at second. She did not mind.\n\n\u2014Seven days in jail, Ben Dollard said, on bread and water. Then you'd sing, Simon, like a garden thrush.\n\nLionel Simon, singer, laughed. Father Bob Cowley played. Mina Kennedy served. Second gentleman paid. Tom Kernan strutted in. Lydia, admired, admired. But Bloom sang dumb.\n\nAdmiring.\n\nRichie, admiring, descanted on that man's glorious voice. He remembered one night long ago. Never forget that night. Si sang 'Twas rank and fame: in Ned Lambert's 'twas. Good God he never heard in all his life a note like that he never did then false one we had better part so clear so God he never heard since love lives not a clinking voice lives not ask Lambert he can tell you too.\n\nGoulding, a flush struggling in his pale, told Mr Bloom, face of the night, Si in Ned Lambert's, Dedalus house, sang 'Twas rank and fame.\n\nHe, Mr Bloom, listened while he, Richie Goulding, told him, Mr Bloom, of the night he, Richie, heard him, Si Dedalus, sing 'TWAS RANK AND FAME in his, Ned Lambert's, house.\n\nBrothers-in-law: relations. We never speak as we pass by. Rift in the lute I think. Treats him with scorn. See. He admires him all the more. The night Si sang. The human voice, two tiny silky chords, wonderful, more than all others.\n\nThat voice was a lamentation. Calmer now. It's in the silence after you feel you hear. Vibrations. Now silent air.\n\nBloom ungyved his crisscrossed hands and with slack fingers plucked the slender catgut thong. He drew and plucked. It buzz, it twanged. While Goulding talked of Barraclough's voice production, while Tom Kernan, harking back in a retrospective sort of arrangement talked to listening Father Cowley, who played a voluntary, who nodded as he played. While big Ben Dollard talked with Simon Dedalus, lighting, who nodded as he smoked, who smoked.\n\nThou lost one. All songs on that theme. Yet more Bloom stretched his string. Cruel it seems. Let people get fond of each other: lure them on. Then tear asunder. Death. Explos. Knock on the head. Outtohelloutofthat. Human life. Dignam. Ugh, that rat's tail wriggling! Five bob I gave. Corpus paradisum. Corncrake croaker: belly like a poisoned pup. Gone. They sing. Forgotten. I too; And one day she with. Leave her: get tired. Suffer then. Snivel. Big spanishy eyes goggling at nothing. Her wavyavyeavyheavyeavyevyevyhair un comb:'d.\n\nYet too much happy bores. He stretched more, more. Are you not happy in your? Twang. It snapped.\n\nJingle into Dorset street.\n\nMiss Douce withdrew her satiny arm, reproachful, pleased.\n\n\u2014Don't make half so free, said she, till we are better acquainted.\n\nGeorge Lidwell told her really and truly: but she did not believe.\n\nFirst gentleman told Mina that was so. She asked him was that so. And second tankard told her so. That that was so.\n\nMiss Douce, miss Lydia, did not believe: miss Kennedy, Mina, did not believe: George Lidwell, no: miss Dou did not: the first, the first: gent with the tank: believe, no, no: did not, miss Kenn: Lidlydiawell: the tank.\n\nBetter write it here. Quills in the postoffice chewed and twisted.\n\nBald Pat at a sign drew nigh. A pen and ink. He went. A pad. He went. A pad to blot. He heard, deaf Pat.\n\n\u2014Yes, Mr Bloom said, teasing the curling catgut line. It certainly is. Few lines will do. My present. All that Italian florid music is. Who is this wrote? Know the name you know better. Take out sheet notepaper, envelope: unconcerned. It's so characteristic.\n\n\u2014Grandest number in the whole opera, Goulding said.\n\n\u2014It is, Bloom said.\n\nNumbers it is. All music when you come to think. Two multiplied by two divided by half is twice one. Vibrations: chords those are. One plus two plus six is seven. Do anything you like with figures juggling. Always find out this equal to that. Symmetry under a cemetery wall. He doesn't see my mourning. Callous: all for his own gut. Musemathematics. And you think you're listening to the etherial. But suppose you said it like: Martha, seven times nine minus x is thirtyfive thousand. Fall quite flat. It's on account of the sounds it is.\n\nInstance he's playing now. Improvising. Might be what you like, till you hear the words. Want to listen sharp. Hard. Begin all right: then hear chords a bit off: feel lost a bit. In and out of sacks, over barrels, through wirefences, obstacle race. Time makes the tune. Question of mood you're in. Still always nice to hear. Except scales up and down, girls learning. Two together nextdoor neighbours. Ought to invent dummy pianos for that. Blumenlied I bought for her. The name. Playing it slow, a girl, night I came home, the girl. Door of the stables near Cecilia street. Milly no taste. Queer because we both, I mean.\n\nBald deaf Pat brought quite flat pad ink. Pat set with ink pen quite flat pad. Pat took plate dish knife fork. Pat went.\n\nIt was the only language Mr Dedalus said to Ben. He heard them as a boy in Ringabella, Crosshaven, Ringabella, singing their barcaroles. Queenstown harbour full of Italian ships. Walking, you know, Ben, in the moonlight with those earthquake hats. Blending their voices. God, such music, Ben. Heard as a boy. Cross Ringabella haven mooncarole.\n\nSour pipe removed he held a shield of hand beside his lips that cooed a moonlight nightcall, clear from anear, a call from afar, replying.\n\nDown the edge of his Freeman baton ranged Bloom's, your other eye, scanning for where did I see that. Callan, Coleman, Dignam Patrick. Heigho! Heigho! Fawcett. Aha! Just I was looking...\n\nHope he's not looking, cute as a rat. He held unfurled his Freeman. Can't see now. Remember write Greek ees. Bloom dipped, Bloo mur: dear sir. Dear Henry wrote: dear Mady. Got your lett and flow. Hell did I put? Some pock or oth. It is utterl imposs. Underline imposs. To write today.\n\nBore this. Bored Bloom tambourined gently with I am just reflecting fingers on flat pad Pat brought.\n\nOn. Know what I mean. No, change that ee. Accep my poor litt pres enclos. Ask her no answ. Hold on. Five Dig. Two about here. Penny the gulls. Elijah is com. Seven Davy Byrne's. Is eight about. Say half a crown. My poor little pres: p. o. two and six. Write me a long. Do you despise? Jingle, have you the? So excited. Why do you call me naught? You naughty too? O, Mairy lost the string of her. Bye for today. Yes, yes, will tell you. Want to. To keep it up. Call me that other. Other world she wrote. My patience are exhaust. To keep it up. You must believe. Believe. The tank. It. Is. True.\n\nFolly am I writing? Husbands don't. That's marriage does, their wives. Because I'm away from. Suppose. But how? She must. Keep young. If she found out. Card in my high grade ha. No, not tell all. Useless pain. If they don't see. Woman. Sauce for the gander.\n\nA hackney car, number three hundred and twentyfour, driver Barton James of number one Harmony avenue, Donnybrook, on which sat a fare, a young gentleman, stylishly dressed in an indigoblue serge suit made by George Robert Mesias, tailor and cutter, of number five Eden quay, and wearing a straw hat very dressy, bought of John Plasto of number one Great Brunswick street, hatter. Eh? This is the jingle that joggled and jingled. By Dlugacz' porkshop bright tubes of Agendath trotted a gallantbuttocked mare.\n\n\u2014Answering an ad? keen Richie's eyes asked Bloom.\n\n\u2014Yes, Mr Bloom said. Town traveller.

And look at the lovely shell she brought.\n\nTo the end of the bar to him she bore lightly the spiked and winding seahorn that he, George Lidwell, solicitor, might hear.\n\n\u2014Listen! she bade him.\n\nUnder Tom Kernan's ginhot words the accompanist wove music slow. Authentic fact. How Walter Bapty lost his voice. Well, sir, the husband took him by the throat. Scoundrel, said he, You'll sing no more lovesongs. He did, faith, sir Tom. Bob Cowley wove. Tenors get wom. Cowley lay back.\n\nAh, now he heard, she holding it to his ear. Hear! He heard.\n\nWonderful. She held it to her own. And through the sifted light pale gold in contrast glided. To hear.\n\nTap.\n\nBloom through the bardoor saw a shell held at their ears. He heard more faintly that that they heard, each for herself alone, then each for other, hearing the plash of waves, loudly, a silent roar.\n\nBronze by a weary gold, anear, afar, they listened.\n\nHer ear too is a shell, the peeping lobe there. Been to the seaside. Lovely seaside girls. Skin tanned raw. Should have put on coldcream first make it brown. Buttered toast. O and that lotion mustn't forget. Fever near her mouth. Your head it simply. Hair braided over: shell with seaweed. Why do they hide their ears with seaweed hair? And Turks the mouth, why? Her eyes over the sheet. Yashmak. Find the way in. A cave. No admittance except on business.\n\nThe sea they think they hear. Singing. A roar. The blood it is. Souse in the ear sometimes. Well, it's a sea. Corpuscle islands.\n\nWonderful really. So distinct. Again. George Lidwell held its murmur, hearing: then laid it by, gently.\n\n\u2014What are the wild waves saying? he asked her, smiled.\n\nCharming, seasmiling and unanswering Lydia on Lidwell smiled.\n\nTap.\n\nBy Larry O'Rourke's, by Larry, bold Larry O', Boylan swayed and Boylan turned.\n\nFrom the forsaken shell miss Mina glided to her tankards waiting. No, she was not so lonely archly miss Douce's head let Mr Lidwell know. Walks in the moonlight by the sea. No, not alone. With whom? She nobly answered: with a gentleman friend.\n\nBob Cowley's twinkling fingers in the treble played again. The landlord has the prior. A little time. Long John. Big Ben. Lightly he played a light bright tinkling measure for tripping ladies, arch and smiling, and for their gallants, gentlemen friends. One: one, one, one, one, one: two, one, three, four.\n\nSea, wind, leaves, thunder, waters, cows lowing, the cattlemarket, cocks, hens don't crow, snakes hissss. There's music everywhere. Ruttledge's door: ee creaking. No, that's noise. Minuet of Don Giovanni he's playing now. Court dresses of all descriptions in castle chambers dancing. Misery. Peasants outside. Green starving faces eating dockleaves. Nice that is. Look: look, look, look, look, look: you look at us.\n\nThat's joyful I can feel. Never have written it. Why? My joy is other joy. But both are joys. Yes, joy it must be. Mere fact of music shows you are. Often thought she was in the dumps till she began to lilt. Then know.\n\nM'Coy valise. My wife and your wife. Squealing cat. Like tearing silk. Tongue when she talks like the clapper of a bellows. They can't manage men's intervals. Gap in their voices too. Fill me. I'm warm, dark, open. Molly in quis est homo: Mercadante. My ear against the wall to hear. Want a woman who can deliver the goods.\n\nJog jig jogged stopped. Dandy tan shoe of dandy Boylan socks skyblue clocks came light to earth.\n\nO, look we are so! Chamber music. Could make a kind of pun on that. It is a kind of music I often thought when she. Acoustics that is. Tinkling. Empty vessels make most noise. Because the acoustics, the resonance changes according as the weight of the water is equal to the law of falling water. Like those rhapsodies of Liszt's, Hungarian, gipsyeyed. Pearls. Drops. Rain. Diddleiddle addleaddle ooddleooddle. Hissss. Now. Maybe now. Before.\n\nOne rapped on a door, one tapped with a knock, did he knock Paul de Kock with a loud proud knocker with a cock carracarracarra cock. Cockcock.\n\nTap.\n\n\u2014Qui sdegno, Ben, said Father Cowley.\n\n\u2014No, Ben, Tom Kernan interfered. The Croppy Boy. Our native Doric.\n\n\u2014Ay do, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. Good men and true.\n\n\u2014Do, do, they begged in one.\n\nI'll go. Here, Pat, return. Come. He came, he came, he did not stay. To me. How much?\n\n\u2014What key? Six sharps?\n\n\u2014F sharp major, Ben Dollard said.\n\nBob Cowley's outstretched talons griped the black deepsounding chords.\n\nMust go prince Bloom told Richie prince. No, Richie said. Yes, must. Got money somewhere. He's on for a razzle backache spree. Much? He seehears lipspeech. One and nine. Penny for yourself. Here. Give him twopence tip. Deaf, bothered. But perhaps he has wife and family waiting, waiting Patty come home. Hee hee hee hee. Deaf wait while they wait.\n\nBut wait. But hear. Chords dark. Lugugugubrious. Low. In a cave of the dark middle earth. Embedded ore. Lumpmusic.\n\nThe voice of dark age, of unlove, earth's fatigue made grave approach and painful, come from afar, from hoary mountains, called on good men and true. The priest he sought. With him would he speak a word.\n\nTap.\n\nBen Dollard's voice. Base barreltone. Doing his level best to say it. Croak of vast manless moonless womoonless marsh. Other comedown. Big ships' chandler's business he did once. Remember: rosiny ropes, ships' lanterns. Failed to the tune of ten thousand pounds. Now in the Iveagh home. Cubicle number so and so. Number one Bass did that for him.\n\nThe priest's at home. A false priest's servant bade him welcome. Step in. The holy father. With bows a traitor servant. Curlycues of chords.\n\nRuin them. Wreck their lives. Then build them cubicles to end their days in. Hushaby. Lullaby. Die, dog. Little dog, die.\n\nThe voice of warning, solemn warning, told them the youth had entered a lonely hall, told them how solemn fell his footsteps there, told them the gloomy chamber, the vested priest sitting to shrive.\n\nDecent soul. Bit addled now. Thinks he'll win in Answers, poets' picture puzzle. We hand you crisp five pound note. Bird sitting hatching in a nest. Lay of the last minstrel he thought it was. See blank tee what domestic animal? Tee dash ar most courageous mariner. Good voice he has still. No eunuch yet with all his belongings.\n\nListen. Bloom listened. Richie Goulding listened. And by the door deaf Pat, bald Pat, tipped Pat, listened. The chords harped slower.\n\nThe voice of penance and of grief came slow, embellished, tremulous. Ben's contrite beard confessed. in nomine Domini, in God's name he knelt. He beat his hand upon his breast, confessing: mea culpa.\n\nLatin again. That holds them like birdlime. Priest with the communion corpus for those women. Chap in the mortuary, coffin or coffey, corpusnomine. Wonder where that rat is by now. Scrape.\n\nTap.\n\nThey listened. Tankards and miss Kennedy. George Lidwell, eyelid well expressive, fullbusted satin. Kernan. Si.\n\nThe sighing voice of sorrow sang. His sins. Since Easter he had cursed three times. You bitch's bast. And once at masstime he had gone to play. Once by the churchyard he had passed and for his mother's rest he had not prayed. A boy. A croppy boy.\n\nBronze, listening, by the beerpull gazed far away. Soulfully. Doesn't half know I'm. Molly great dab at seeing anyone looking.\n\nBronze gazed far sideways. Mirror there. Is that best side of her face? They always know. Knock at the door. Last tip to titivate.\n\nCockcarracarra.\n\nWhat do they think when they hear music? Way to catch rattlesnakes. Night Michael Gunn gave us the box. Tuning up. Shah of Persia liked that best. Remind him of home sweet home. Wiped his nose in curtain too. Custom his country perhaps. That's music too. Not as bad as it sounds. Tootling. Brasses braying asses through uptrunks. Doublebasses helpless, gashes in their sides. Woodwinds mooing cows. Semigrand open crocodile music hath jaws. Woodwind like Goodwin's name.\n\nShe looked fine. Her crocus dress she wore lowcut, belongings on show. Clove her breath was always in theatre when she bent to ask a question. Told her what Spinoza says in that book of poor papa's. Hypnotised, listening. Eyes like that. She bent. Chap in dresscircle staring down into her with his operaglass for all he was worth. Beauty of music you must hear twice. Nature woman half a look. God made the country man the tune. Met him pike hoses. Philosophy. O rocks!\n\nAll gone. All fallen. At the siege of Ross his father, at Gorey all his brothers fell. To Wexford, we are the boys of Wexford, he would. Last of his name and race.\n\nI too. Last of my race. Milly young student. Well, my fault perhaps. No son. Rudy. Too late now. Or if not? If not? If still?\n\nHe bore no hate.\n\nHate. Love. Those are names. Rudy. Soon I am old. Big Ben his voice unfolded. Great voice Richie Goulding said, a flush struggling in his pale, to Bloom soon old. But when was young?\n\nIreland comes now. My country above the king. She listens. Who fears to speak of nineteen four? Time to be shoving. Looked enough.\n\n\u2014Bless me, father, Dollard the croppy cried. Bless me and let me go.\n\nTap.\n\nBloom looked, unblessed to go. Got up to kill: on eighteen bob a week. Fellows shell out the dibs. Want to keep your weathereye open. Those girls, those lovely. By the sad sea waves. Chorusgirl's romance. Letters read out for breach of promise. From Chickabiddy's owny Mumpsypum. Laughter in court. Henry. I never signed it. The lovely name you.\n\nLow sank the music, air and words. Then hastened. The false priest rustling soldier from his cassock. A yeoman captain. They know it all by heart. The thrill they itch for. Yeoman cap.\n\nTap. Tap.\n\nThrilled she listened, bending in sympathy to hear.\n\nBlank face. Virgin should say: or fingered only. Write something on it: page. If not what becomes of them? Decline, despair. Keeps them young. Even admire themselves. See. Play on her. Lip blow. Body of white woman, a flute alive. Blow gentle. Loud. Three holes, all women. Goddess I didn't see. They want it. Not too much polite. That's why he gets them. Gold in your pocket, brass in your face. Say something. Make her hear. With look to look. Songs without words. Molly, that hurdygurdy boy. She knew he meant the monkey was sick. Or because so like the Spanish. Understand animals too that way. Solomon did. Gift of nature.\n\nVentriloquise. My lips closed. Think in my stom. What?\n\nWill? You? I. Want. You. To.\n\nWith hoarse rude fury the yeoman cursed, swelling in apoplectic bitch's bastard. A good thought, boy, to come. One hour's your time to live, your last.\n\nTap. Tap.\n\nThrill now. Pity they feel. To wipe away a tear for martyrs that want to, dying to, die. For all things dying, for all things born. Poor Mrs Purefoy. Hope she's over. Because their wombs.\n\nA liquid of womb of woman eyeball gazed under a fence of lashes, calmly, hearing. See real beauty of the eye when she not speaks. On yonder river. At each slow satiny heaving bosom's wave (her heaving embon) red rose rose slowly sank red rose. Heartbeats: her breath: breath that is life. And all the tiny tiny fernfoils trembled of maidenhair.\n\nBut look. The bright stars fade. O rose! Castile. The morn. Ha. Lidwell. For him then not for. Infatuated. I like that? See her from here though. Popped corks, splashes of beerfroth, stacks of empties.\n\nOn the smooth jutting beerpull laid Lydia hand, lightly, plumply, leave it to my hands. All lost in pity for croppy. Fro, to: to, fro: over the polished knob (she knows his eyes, my eyes, her eyes) her thumb and finger passed in pity: passed, reposed and, gently touching, then slid so smoothly, slowly down, a cool firm white enamel baton protruding through their sliding ring.\n\nWith a cock with a carra.\n\nTap. Tap. Tap.\n\nI hold this house. Amen. He gnashed in fury. Traitors swing.\n\nThe chords consented. Very sad thing. But had to be. Get out before the end. Thanks, that was heavenly. Where's my hat. Pass by her. Can leave that Freeman. Letter I have. Suppose she were the? No. Walk, walk, walk. Like Cashel Boylo Connoro Coylo Tisdall Maurice Tisntdall Farrell. Waaaaaaalk.\n\nWell, I must be. Are you off? Yrfmstbyes. Blmstup. O'er ryehigh blue. Ow. Bloom stood up. Soap feeling rather sticky behind. Must have sweated: music. That lotion, remember. Well, so long. High grade. Card inside. Yes.\n\nBy deaf Pat in the doorway straining ear Bloom passed.\n\nAt Geneva barrack that young man died. At Passage was his body laid. Dolor! O, he dolores! The voice of the mournful chanter called to dolorous prayer.\n\nBy rose, by satiny bosom, by the fondling hand, by slops, by empties, by popped corks, greeting in going, past eyes and maidenhair, bronze and faint gold in deepseashadow, went Bloom, soft Bloom, I feel so lonely Bloom.\n\nTap. Tap. Tap.\n\nPray for him, prayed the bass of Dollard. You who hear in peace. Breathe a prayer, drop a tear, good men, good people. He was the croppy boy.\n\nScaring eavesdropping boots croppy bootsboy Bloom in the Ormond hallway heard the growls and roars of bravo, fat backslapping, their boots all treading, boots not the boots the boy. General chorus off for a swill to wash it down. Glad I avoided.\n\n\u2014Come on, Ben, Simon Dedalus cried. By God, you're as good as ever you were.\n\n\u2014Better, said Tomgin Kernan. Most trenchant rendition of that ballad, upon my soul and honour It is.\n\n\u2014Lablache, said Father Cowley.\n\nBen Dollard bulkily cachuchad towards the bar, mightily praisefed and all big roseate, on heavyfooted feet, his gouty fingers nakkering castagnettes in the air.\n\nBig Benaben Dollard. Big Benben. Big Benben.\n\nRrr.\n\nAnd deepmoved all, Simon trumping compassion from foghorn nose, all laughing they brought him forth, Ben Dollard, in right good cheer.\n\n\u2014You're looking rubicund, George Lidwell said.\n\nMiss Douce composed her rose to wait.\n\n\u2014Ben machree, said Mr Dedalus, clapping Ben's fat back shoulderblade. Fit as a fiddle only he has a lot of adipose tissue concealed about his person.\n\nRrrrrrrsss.\n\n\u2014Fat of death, Simon, Ben Dollard growled.\n\nRichie rift in the lute alone sat: Goulding, Collis, Ward. Uncertainly he waited. Unpaid Pat too.\n\nTap. Tap. Tap. Tap.\n\nMiss Mina Kennedy brought near her lips to ear of tankard one.\n\n\u2014Mr Dollard, they murmured low.\n\n\u2014Dollard, murmured tankard.\n\nTank one believed: miss Kenn when she: that doll he was: she doll: the tank.\n\nHe murmured that he knew the name. The name was familiar to him, that is to say. That was to say he had heard the name of. Dollard, was it? Dollard, yes.\n\nYes, her lips said more loudly, Mr Dollard. He sang that song lovely, murmured Mina. Mr Dollard. And The last rose of summer was a lovely song. Mina loved that song. Tankard loved the song that Mina.\n\n'Tis the last rose of summer dollard left bloom felt wind wound round inside.\n\nGassy thing that cider: binding too. Wait. Postoffice near Reuben J's one and eightpence too. Get shut of it. Dodge round by Greek street. Wish I hadn't promised to meet. Freer in air. Music. Gets on your nerves. Beerpull. Her hand that rocks the cradle rules the. Ben Howth. That rules the world.\n\nFar. Far. Far. Far.\n\nTap. Tap. Tap. Tap.\n\nUp the quay went Lionelleopold, naughty Henry with letter for Mady, with sweets of sin with frillies for Raoul with met him pike hoses went Poldy on.\n\nTap blind walked tapping by the tap the curbstone tapping, tap by tap.\n\nCowley, he stuns himself with it: kind of drunkenness. Better give way only half way the way of a man with a maid. Instance enthusiasts. All ears. Not lose a demisemiquaver. Eyes shut. Head nodding in time. Dotty. You daren't budge. Thinking strictly prohibited. Always talking shop. Fiddlefaddle about notes.\n\nAll a kind of attempt to talk. Unpleasant when it stops because you never know exac. Organ in Gardiner street. Old Glynn fifty quid a year. Queer up there in the cockloft, alone, with stops and locks and keys. Seated all day at the organ. Maunder on for hours, talking to himself or the other fellow blowing the bellows. Growl angry, then shriek cursing (want to have wadding or something in his no don't she cried), then all of a soft sudden wee little wee little pipy wind.\n\nPwee! A wee little wind piped eeee. In Bloom's little wee.\n\n\u2014Was he? Mr Dedalus said, returning with fetched pipe. I was with him this morning at poor little Paddy Dignam's...\n\n\u2014Ay, the Lord have mercy on him.\n\n\u2014By the bye there's a tuningfork in there on the...\n\nTap. Tap. Tap. Tap.\n\n\u2014The wife has a fine voice. Or had. What? Lidwell asked.\n\n\u2014O, that must be the tuner, Lydia said to Simonlionel first I saw, forgot it when he was here.\n\nBlind he was she told George Lidwell second I saw. And played so exquisitely, treat to hear. Exquisite contrast: bronzelid, minagold.\n\n\u2014Shout! Ben Dollard shouted, pouring. Sing out!\n\n\u2014'lldo! cried Father Cowley.\n\nRrrrrr.\n\nI feel I want...\n\nTap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap\n\n\u2014Very, Mr Dedalus said, staring hard at a headless sardine.\n\nUnder the sandwichbell lay on a bier of bread one last, one lonely, last sardine of summer. Bloom alone.\n\n\u2014Very, he stared. The lower register, for choice.\n\nTap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.\n\nBloom went by Barry's. Wish I could. Wait. That wonderworker if I had. Twentyfour solicitors in that one house. Counted them. Litigation. Love one another. Piles of parchment. Messrs Pick and Pocket have power of attorney. Goulding, Collis, Ward.\n\nBut for example the chap that wallops the big drum. His vocation: Mickey Rooney's band. Wonder how it first struck him. Sitting at home after pig's cheek and cabbage nursing it in the armchair. Rehearsing his band part. Pom. Pompedy. Jolly for the wife. Asses' skins. Welt them through life, then wallop after death. Pom. Wallop. Seems to be what you call yashmak or I mean kismet. Fate.\n\nTap. Tap. A stripling, blind, with a tapping cane came taptaptapping by Daly's window where a mermaid hair all streaming (but he couldn't see) blew whiffs of a mermaid (blind couldn't), mermaid, coolest whiff of all.\n\nInstruments. A blade of grass, shell of her hands, then blow. Even comb and tissuepaper you can knock a tune out of. Molly in her shift in Lombard street west, hair down. I suppose each kind of trade made its own, don't you see? Hunter with a horn. Haw. Have you the? Cloche. Sonnez la. Shepherd his pipe. Pwee little wee. Policeman a whistle. Locks and keys! Sweep!

Just a question of custom shah of Persia. Breathe a prayer, drop a tear. All the same he must have been a bit of a natural not to see it was a yeoman cap. Muffled up. Wonder who was that chap at the grave in the brown macin. O, the whore of the lane!\n\nA frowsy whore with black straw sailor hat askew came glazily in the day along the quay towards Mr Bloom. When first he saw that form endearing? Yes, it is. I feel so lonely. Wet night in the lane. Horn. Who had the? Heehaw shesaw. Off her beat here. What is she? Hope she. Psst! Any chance of your wash. Knew Molly. Had me decked. Stout lady does be with you in the brown costume. Put you off your stroke, that. Appointment we made knowing we'd never, well hardly ever. Too dear too near to home sweet home. Sees me, does she? Looks a fright in the day. Face like dip. Damn her. O, well, she has to live like the rest. Look in here.\n\nIn Lionel Marks's antique saleshop window haughty Henry Lionel Leopold dear Henry Flower earnestly Mr Leopold Bloom envisaged battered candlesticks melodeon oozing maggoty blowbags. Bargain: six bob. Might learn to play. Cheap. Let her pass. Course everything is dear if you don't want it. That's what good salesman is. Make you buy what he wants to sell. Chap sold me the Swedish razor he shaved me with. Wanted to charge me for the edge he gave it. She's passing now. Six bob.\n\nMust be the cider or perhaps the burgund.\n\nNear bronze from anear near gold from afar they chinked their clinking glasses all, brighteyed and gallant, before bronze Lydia's tempting last rose of summer, rose of Castile. First Lid, De, Cow, Ker, Doll, a fifth: Lidwell, Si Dedalus, Bob Cowley, Kernan and big Ben Dollard.\nTap. A youth entered a lonely Ormond hall.\n\nBloom viewed a gallant pictured hero in Lionel Marks's window. Robert Emmet's last words. Seven last words. Of Meyerbeer that is.\n\n\u2014True men like you men.\n\n\u2014Ay, ay, Ben.\n\n\u2014Will lift your glass with us.\n\nThey lifted.\n\nTschink. Tschunk.\n\nTip.
