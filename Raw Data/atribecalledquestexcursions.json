'Cause I gotta speak the truth, man\nDoin' what we feel for the music is the proof, and\nPlanted on the ground, the act is so together\nBona fide strong, you need leverage to sever\nThe unit, yes, the unit, yes, the unit called the jazz is\nDelivering each year an LP filled with street goods\nYou can find it on your rack in your record store\nIf you get the record, say your thoughts are adored\nAnd appreciated, 'cause we're ever so glad we made it\nWe work hard, so we gotta thank God\nDishin' out the plastic, do the dance till you're spastic\nIf you diss\u2014it gets drastic\nListen to the rhyme, 'cause it's time to make gravy\nIf it moves your booty, then shake, shake it, baby\nAll the way to Africa, A.K.A. the Motherland\nStick out the left, then I'll ask for the other hand\nThat's the right hand, Black man\nOnly if you are noted as my man\nIf I get the credit, then I think I deserve it\nIf you fake moves, don't fix your mouth to word it\nGet in the zone of positivity, not negativity\n'Cause we gotta strive for longevity\nIf you botch up, what's in that [ass]\n(What?) A pair of Nikes, size ten-and-a-half\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nWe gotta make moves (words)\nNever, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)\nWe gotta make moves (words)\nNever, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)\nWe gotta make moves\nNever, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)\nWe gotta make moves\nNever, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)\n\n[Interlude: Sample]\n\"Time, time is a ship on a merciless sea\nDrifting toward an abyss of nothingness\nUntil it can be recharted for its own destiny\nTime is an inanimate object paying and paying and paying for no justification for belief\nTime is dancing, boogalooing-away all memories of past\u2014\"\n\n[Verse 2: Q-Tip]\nWe gotta be a winner all the time\nCan't fall prey to a hip-hop crime\nWith the dope raps and dope tracks we move blocks\nFrom the fly girlies to the hardest of the rocks\nMusically the Quest, is on the rise\nWe on these excursions so you must realize\nThat continually, I pop my Zulu [shit]\nIf you don't like it, get off the Zulu tip\nSo what can you do in the times which exist\nYou can't fake moves on your brother or your sis\nBut if your sis is a [bitch], brother is a jerk\nLeave 'em both alone and continue with your work\nWhatever it may be in today's society\nEverything is fair, least that's how it seems to me\nYou must be honest and true to the next\nDon't be phony and expect one not to flex\nEspecially if you rhyme, you have to live by the pen\nYour man is your man, then treat him like your friend\nAll it is, is the code of the streets\nSo listen to the knowledge being dropped over beats\nBeats that are hard, beats that are funky\nThey could get you hooked like a crackhead junkie\nWhat you gotta do is know the Tribe is in the sphere\nThe Abstract Poet, prominent like Shakespeare\n(Or Edgar Allan Poe, or Langston Hughes, or...)\n[Chorus]\nWe gotta make moves\nNever, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)\nWe gotta make moves\nNever, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)\nWe gotta make moves\nNever, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)\nWe gotta make moves\nNever, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)\n\n[Outro: Sample + Q-Tip]\n\"\u2014time is running out on black power advocates in the day and white thighed supporters at night\nEvery time you see them, they're chasin' some white woman with their tongue hangin' out\nTime is running and passing, passing and running, running and passing, passing and running\u2014\"\nExcursions39Embed"
