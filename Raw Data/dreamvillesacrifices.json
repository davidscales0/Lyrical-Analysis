Cole]\nHuggin' the block, huggin' the block all day\nI had nowhere to go, she gave me a place to stay\nShe gave me her heart to hold, I still got that shit to this day\nShe ridin' with me on the road, she ridin' with me in the A\nHuggin' the block, huggin' the block, okay\nShe gave me the gift of my son, and plus we got one on the way\nShe gave me a family to love, for that, I can never repay\nI'm crying while writing these words, the tears, they feel good on my face, hey\n\n[Refrain: J. Cole]\nAnd yesterday could feel just like a waste, yeah\nIf I don't love you how I'm supposed to\nAnd yesterday could feel just like a waste, yeah\nIf I don't love you how I'm supposed to\n\n[Chorus: Johnny Venus]\nI make sacrifices, bloody sacrifices95Embed"
