Comin' around to get saved\nI don't wanna war, let's make peace\nGood energies make the stacks increase\nGirls in the North, West, South and the East\nBig batty make the mandem say jheeze\n\"I'm not a gentleman, I'm an African man\"\nIs what I said to the priest\nSo you know I stay smokin' trees\nAnd the buds in the zip pack looking obese\nSee Skepta LiveGet tickets as low as $294You might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nI just came back from Mars in my new spaceship\nIt was a perfect landin' (Perfect!)\nWhat you mean, \"what you mean\"? I'm a king, she's a queen\nMan, you know what's happenin' (Sexy)\nNowadays, they call me ginger bread man 'cah they just can't catch him\nAll the ladies love man, I love them too, we got an understanding (Ice)\n\n[Chorus]\nPure water and lots of ice, she knows that I be the boss of life\nPure water and lots of ice, she knows that I be the boss of life\nPure water and lots of ice, she knows that I be the boss of life\nCity on lock from the left to the right\nBare girls, how am I meant to decide?\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe weren't feelin' the old me, I bet she's feelin' my new shit\nI told her we gotta keep it true, told her we gotta move as a unit\nI had to chat to Cupid, said, \"Little man, you know I ain't stupid\"\nTold you that it's more than music\nPaps outside tryna get an exclusive\nInstead of looking for the top boy\nMust've been looking for me, well, who's askin'?\nI clocked the game, I'm still barrin'\nPlease don't speak to me when I'm dancin' (Wow)\nEvery day, they pray that I fall off\nI'm poppin' up like, \"What's gwarnin'?\"\nThey say a girl is a gun\nSee a man walkin' with his wife and I disarm him\nThe way I stepped in there with the SK Air, fam' serious tekkers\nBrand new vest, same old leathers\nShe knows we are the real Goodfellas\nWe can be cool, yeah we can ride out\nPlease just don't get jealous\nStart textin' me crazy, I gotta take desperate measures\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI just came back from Mars in my new spaceship\nIt was a perfect landing\nWhat you mean, \"what you mean\"? I'm a king she's a queen\nMan you know what's happenin' (Ice)\nNowadays they call me ginger bread man 'cah they just can't catch him\nAll the ladies love man, I love them too, we got an understanding\n\n[Chorus]\nPure water and lots of ice, she knows that I be the boss of life\nPure water and lots of ice, she knows that I be the boss of life\nPure water and lots of ice, she knows that I be the boss of life\nCity on lock from the left to the right\nBare girls, how am I meant to decide?15Embed"
