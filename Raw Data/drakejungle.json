Are we still good?\nAre we still good? Are we still good?\nIf I need to talk, are you around?\nAre you down for the cause?\nAre you down? Are you down? Are you down?\nAre you down for the cause?\nAre you down? Are you down? Are you down?\nAre you down for the cause?\nYou still down? You still down? You still down?\n\n[Chorus: Gabriel Garz\u00f3n Montano & Drake]\nRock me real slowly (Yeah)\nPut a bib on me\nI'm just like a baby, droolin' over you\n(Give me back) The things you do\n[Verse 3: Drake]\nYeah, these days, these new girls, they got me nervous\nThey go to school and do bottle service\nThey can't decide, they keep switchin' majors\nBeing indecisive makes me anxious\nCall your number and it's out of service\nWho can I call for your information?\nWhat am I supposed to do after we done everything that we done?\nWho is your replacement?\nAre we still good? Are we still good?\nAre we still good? Are we still good?\n\n[Outro: Gabriel Garz\u00f3n Montano]\n(The things you do)\n(Rock me real slowly)\n(Rock me real slowly)\n(I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you)\n(Rock me real slowly)\n(Rock\u2500, put a bib on me)\n(Give me back)885Embed"
