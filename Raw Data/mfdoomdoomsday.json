You silly\nI'd like to take \"Mens to the End\" for two milli'\n\"Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!\" That's a audio daily double\nRappers need to fall off just to save me the trouble, yo\nWatch your own back; came in and go out alone, black\nStay in the zone, turn H2O to Cognac\nYou might also like[Chorus: MF DOOM]\nOn Doomsday, ever since the womb\n\u2018Til I'm back where my brother went, that's what my tomb will say\nRight above my government; Dumile\nEither unmarked or engraved; hey, who's to say?\n\n[Verse 2: MF DOOM]\nI wrote this one in B.C. D.C. O-section\nIf you don't believe me, go get bagged and check then\nCell number seventeen, up under the top bunk\nI say this not to be mean, wish bad luck or pop junk\nPop the trunk on Cee Cipher Punk, leave him left scraped\nGod forbid, if there ain't no escape, blame MF tape\nDefinition \"super-villain\": a killer who love children\nOne who is well-skilled in destruction, as well as building\nWhile Sidney Sheldon teaches the trife to be trifer\nI'm trading science fiction with my man the live lifer\nA pied piper holler a rhyme, a dollar and a dime\nDo his thing, ring around the white collar crime\nGet out my face, askin' 'bout my case, need toothpaste\nFresher mint, monkey-style nigga get Mentadent\nAnd dope fiends still in they teens, shook niggas turn witness\nReal mens mind their own business\nThat's the difference between sissy-pissy rappers that's double-dutch\nHow come I hold the microphone double-clutch?\nC.O.'s make rounds, never have \u2018ox found\nOn shakedown, lock-down, wet dreams of Fox' Brown\n[Chorus: MF DOOM]\nOn Doomsday, ever since the womb\n'Til I'm back where my brother went, that's what my tomb will say\nRight above my government; Dumile\nEither unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say?\n\n[Verse 3: MF DOOM]\nDoomsday, ever since the womb\n'Til I'm back to the essence, read it off the tomb\nEither engraved or unmarked grave, who's to say?\nPass the mic like \"Pass the peas like they used to say\"\nSome M-er F-ers don't like how Sally walk\nI'll tell y'all fools it's hella cool how ladies from Cali talk\nNever let her interfere with the Yeti ghetto slang\nNicknames off nibblin' tip of nipples, metal fang\nKnown amongst hoes for the bang-bang\nKnown amongst foes for flow without no talking orangutans\nOnly gin and Tang guzzled out a rusty tin can\nMe and this mic is like yin and yang\nClang; crime don't pay; listen, youth\nIt's like me holding up the line at the kissing booth\nI took her back to the truck, she was uncouth\nSpittin' all out the sunroof, through her missing tooth\nBut then she has a sexy voice, sound like Jazzy Joyce\nSo I turned it up faster than a speeding knife\nStrong enough to please a wife\nAble to drop today's math in the forty-eight keys of life\nCut the crap farce rap\nTouch the mic, get the same thing a Arab will do to you for stealing\nWhat the Devil? He's on another level\nIt's a word! No, a name! MF the Super-Villain!\n[Outro: Pebbles the Invisible Girl & MF Doom]\nDoomsday\nTo dig the sound\nCrowd around\nWhen I was led to you\nI knew you were the one for me\nI swear the whole world could feel you, MC164Embed"
