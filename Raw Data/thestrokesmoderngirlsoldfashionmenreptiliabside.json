Right? Right? Right? Right?\nI don't belong\n\n[Chorus: Julian Casablancas & Regina Spektor]\nWhy you gotta say it if you know it's sounding wrong? (Why you sitting over there?)\nSays that he'll apologize and it won't take too long\nWell, you don't wanna trust nobody else (Always thinking 'bout yourself)\n\n[Verse 2: Julian Casablancas, Regina Spektor, Both]\n(Time) There's a few things that are gonna have to change\n(I'm your son) Everyone has the same opinion\n(Won't you please?) Your time is almost over\n(Don't be mean) We won't get the chance to do this over\n(That's alright) Right? Right? Right? Right? Right?\nI don't belong\n\n[Chorus: Julian Casablancas & Regina Spektor]\nI don't want the imprint of your key upon my nose (Why you sitting over there?)\nYou don't have to tell no one 'cause no one wants to know\nWell, you don't have no happiness at home (Always thinking 'bout yourself)\nYou might also like[Bridge: Julian Casablancas, Regina Spektor, Both]\nShh\nOh yes, we're falling down\nOh yes, we're falling down\nOh yes, we're falling down\nOh yes, we're falling down (Yes, we're falling down)\nOh yes, we're falling down\nOh yes, we're falling down\nOh yes, we're falling down\nSo fuckin' help me up\n\n[Outro: Julian Casablancas, Regina Spektor, Both]\nAlways thinking 'bout yourself (You don't love me)\nAlways thinking 'bout yourself (I am an animal)\nAlways thinking 'bout yourself (I am not practical)\nWas I?Embed"
