Light man up like souffl\u00e9\nAll my babes all like touch\u00e9\nGave her dick and that bright red bouquet\nI get dark like true say\nFlip things in my niz, get smash for the rude face\nI'll mash your girl first something like Sunday, then Zuu, you can be third like TuesdayYou might also likeEmbed"
