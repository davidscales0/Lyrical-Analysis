I don't even like it\nI just lied to get to your apartment\nNow I'm stayin' there just for a while\nI can't think 'cause I'm just way too tired\n[Chorus]\nIs this it?\nIs this it?\nIs this it?\n\n[Verse 2]\nSaid they'd give you anything you ever wanted\nWhen they lied, I knew it was just stable\nChildren tryin' hard not to realize\nI was sitting right behind you\n\n[Bridge]\nDear, can't you see? It's them, it's not me\nWe're not enemies, we just disagree\nIf I was like him, all pissed in this bar\nHe changes his mind, says I went too far\nWe all disagree, I think we should disagree, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nIs this it?\nIs this it?\nIs this it?\nYou might also like[Outro]\nCan't you see I'm tryin'? I don't even like it\nI just lied to get to your apartment\nNow I'm stayin' there just for a while\nI can't think 'cause I'm just way too tired38Embed"
