Love Me Tender\"\nThe letter came back three days later \"Return to Sender\", damn\n[Chorus: Fatlip]\nShe keeps on passin' me by\nShe keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)\nShe keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)\nShe keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)\nShe keeps on pass\u2014\n[Post-Chorus]\nNevertheless, I'll say it again (Passing me by)\nNevertheless, I'll say it again\nNevertheless\u2014\nNevertheless\u2014\nNevertheless, I'll say it again\n\n[Outro]\nShe keeps passin' me by\nShe keeps passin' me by (I'll say it again)\nShe keeps passin' me by\nShe keeps passin' me by (I'll say it again)\nShe keeps passin' me by\nShe keeps passin' me by (I'll say it again)\nShe keeps passin' me by\nShe keeps passin' me by (I'll say it again)53Embed"
