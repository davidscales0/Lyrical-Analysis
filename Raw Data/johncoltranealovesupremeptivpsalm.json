Scene 1 LyricsA ROOM IN MOROSE'S HOUSE.\nENTER LA-FOOLE, CLERIMONT, AND DAW.\nLa-F:\nWhere had you our swords, master Clerimont?\n\nCler:\nWhy, Dauphine took them from the madman.\n\nLa-F:\nAnd he took them from our boys, I warrant you.\n\nCler:\nVery like, sir.\n\nLa-F:\nThank you, good master Clerimont. Sir John Daw and I are\nboth beholden to you.\n\nCler:\nWould I knew how to make you so, gentlemen!\n\nDaw:\nSir Amorous and I are your servants, sir.\n[ENTER MAVIS.]\n\nMav:\nGentlemen, have any of you a pen and ink? I would fain write\nout a riddle in Italian, for sir Dauphine, to translate.\n\nCler:\nNot I, in troth lady; I am no scrivener.\n\nDaw:\nI can furnish you, I think, lady.\n\n[EXEUNT DAW AND MAVIS.]\n\nCler:\nHe has it in the haft of a knife, I believe.\n\nLa-F:\nNo, he has his box of instruments.\n\nCler:\nLike a surgeon!\n\nLa-F:\nFor the mathematics: his square, his compasses, his brass\npens, and black-lead, to draw maps of every place and person\nwhere he comes.\nCler:\nHow, maps of persons!\n\nLa-F:\nYes, sir, of Nomentack when he was here, and of the Prince of\nMoldavia, and of his mistress, mistress Epicoene.\n\n[RE-ENTER DAW.]\n\nCler:\nAway! he hath not found out her latitude, I hope.\n\nLa-F:\nYou are a pleasant gentleman, sir.\n\nCler:\nFaith, now we are in private, let's wanton it a little, and\ntalk waggishly.\u2014Sir John, I am telling sir Amorous here, that you\ntwo govern the ladies wherever you come; you carry the feminine\ngender afore you.\n\nDaw:\nThey shall rather carry us afore them, if they will, sir.\n\nCler:\nNay, I believe that they do, withal\u2014but that you are the\nprime men in their affections, and direct all their actions\u2014\nDaw:\nNot I: sir Amorous is.\n\nLa-F:\nI protest, sir John is.\n\nDaw:\nAs I hope to rise in the state, sir Amorous, you have the\nperson.\n\nLa-F:\nSir John, you have the person, and the discourse too.\n\nDaw:\nNot I, sir. I have no discourse\u2014and then you have activity\nbeside.\n\nLa-F:\nI protest, sir John, you come as high from Tripoly as I do,\nevery whit: and lift as many join'd stools, and leap over them,\nif you would use it.\n\nCler:\nWell, agree on't together knights; for between you, you\ndivide the kingdom or commonwealth of ladies' affections: I see\nit, and can perceive a little how they observe you, and fear you,\nindeed. You could tell strange stories, my masters, if you would,\nI know.\n\nDaw:\nFaith, we have seen somewhat, sir.\n\nLa-F:\nThat we have\u2014velvet petticoats, and wrought smocks, or so.\n\nDaw:\nAy, and\u2014\n\nCler:\nNay, out with it, sir John: do not envy your friend the\npleasure of hearing, when you have had the delight of tasting.\n\nDaw:\nWhy\u2014a\u2014do you speak, sir Amorous.\n\nLa-F:\nNo, do you, sir John Daw.\n\nDaw:\nI'faith, you shall.\n\nLa-F:\nI'faith, you shall.\n\nDaw:\nWhy, we have been\u2014\n\nLa-F:\nIn the great bed at Ware together in our time. On, sir\nJohn.\n\nDaw:\nNay, do you, sir Amorous.\n\nCler:\nAnd these ladies with you, knights?\n\nLa-F:\nNo, excuse us, sir.\n\nDaw:\nWe must not wound reputation.\n\nLa-F:\nNo matter\u2014they were these, or others. Our bath cost us\nfifteen pound when we came home.\n\nCler:\nDo you hear, sir John? You shall tell me but one thing\ntruly, as you love me.\n\nDaw:\nIf I can, I will, sir.\n\nCler:\nYou lay in the same house with the bride, here?\n\nDaw:\nYes, and conversed with her hourly, sir.\n\nCler:\nAnd what humour is she of? Is she coming, and open, free?\n\nDaw:\nO, exceeding open, sir. I was her servant, and sir Amorous was\nto be.\n\nCler:\nCome, you have both had favours from her: I know, and have\nheard so much.\n\nDaw:\nO no, sir.\n\nLa-F:\nYou shall excuse us, sir: we must not wound reputation.\n\nCler:\nTut, she is married now, and you cannot hurt her with any\nreport; and therefore speak plainly: how many times, i'faith?\nwhich of you led first? ha!\n\nLa-F:\nSir John had her maidenhead, indeed.\n\nDaw:\nO, it pleases him to say so, sir, but sir Amorous knows what\nis what, as well.\n\nCler:\nDost thou i'faith, Amorous?\n\nLa-F:\nIn a manner, sir.\n\nCler:\nWhy, I commend you lads. Little knows don Bridegroom of\nthis. Nor shall he, for me.\n\nDaw:\nHang him, mad ox!\n\nCler:\nSpeak softly: here comes his nephew, with the lady Haughty.\nHe'll get the ladies from you, sirs, if you look not to him in\ntime.\n\nLa-F:\nWhy, if he do, we'll fetch them home again, I warrant you.\n\n[EXIT WITH DAW. CLER. WALKS ASIDE.]\n\n[ENTER DAUPHINE AND HAUGHTY.]\n\nHau:\nI assure you, sir Dauphine, it is the price and estimation\nof your virtue only, that hath embark'd me to this adventure; and\nI could not but make out to tell you so; nor can I repent me of\nthe act, since it is always an argument of some virtue in our\nselves, that we love and affect it so in others.\n\nDaup:\nYour ladyship sets too high a price on my weakness.\n\nHau:\nSir, I can distinguish gems from pebbles\u2014\n\nDaup [ASIDE.]:\nAre you so skilful in stones?\n\nHau:\nAnd howsover I may suffer in such a judgment as yours, by\nadmitting equality of rank or society with Centaure or Mavis\u2014\n\nDaup:\nYou do not, madam; I perceive they are your mere foils.\n\nHau:\nThen, are you a friend to truth, sir; it makes me love you\nthe more. It is not the outward, but the inward man that I affect.\nThey are not apprehensive of an eminent perfection, but love flat,\nand dully.\n\nCen [within.]:\nWhere are you, my lady Haughty?\n\nHau:\nI come presently, Centaure.\u2014My chamber, sir, my page shall\nshew you; and Trusty, my woman, shall be ever awake for you: you\nneed not fear to communicate any thing with her, for she is a\nFidelia. I pray you wear this jewel for my sake, sir Dauphine.\u2014\n\n[ENTER CENTAURE.]\n\nWhere is Mavis, Centaure?\n\nCen:\nWithin, madam, a writing. I'll follow you presently:\n\n[EXIT HAU.]\n\nI'll but speak a word with sir Dauphine.\n\nDaup:\nWith me, madam?\n\nCen:\nGood sir Dauphine, do not trust Haughty, nor make any credit\nto her, whatever you do besides. Sir Dauphine, I give you this\ncaution, she is a perfect courtier, and loves nobody but for her\nuses: and for her uses she loves all. Besides, her physicians give\nher out to be none o' the clearest, whether she pay them or no,\nheaven knows: and she's above fifty too, and pargets! See her in\na forenoon. Here comes Mavis, a worse face then she! you would\nnot like this, by candle-light.\n\n[RE-ENTER MAVIS.]\n\nIf you'll come to my chamber one o' these mornings early, or late\nin an evening, I will tell you more. Where's Haughty, Mavis?\n\nMav:\nWithin, Centaure.\n\nCen:\nWhat have you, there?\n\nMav:\nAn Italian riddle for sir Dauphine,\u2014you shall not see it\ni'faith, Centaure.\u2014\n\n[EXIT CEN.]\n\nGood sir Dauphine, solve it for me. I'll call for it anon.\n\n[EXIT.]\n\nCler [COMING FORWARD.]:\nHow now, Dauphine! how dost thou quit\nthyself of these females?\n\nDaup:\n'Slight, they haunt me like fairies, and give me jewels\nhere; I cannot be rid of them.\n\nCler:\nO, you must not tell though.\n\nDaup:\nMass, I forgot that: I was never so assaulted. One loves\nfor virtue, and bribes me with this;\n[SHEWS THE JEWEL.]\n\u2014another loves me with caution, and so would possess me; a\nthird brings me a riddle here: and all are jealous: and rail each\nat other.\n\nCler:\nA riddle! pray let me see it.\n[READS.]\nSir Dauphine, I chose this way of intimation for privacy. The\nladies here, I know, have both hope and purpose to make a\ncollegiate and servant of you. If I might be so honoured, as to\nappear at any end of so noble a work, I would enter into a fame\nof taking physic to-morrow, and continue it four or five days,\nor longer, for your visitation. Mavis.\nBy my faith, a subtle one! Call you this a riddle? what's their\nplain dealing, trow?\n\nDaup:\nWe lack Truewit to tell us that.\n\nCler:\nWe lack him for somewhat else too: his knights reformadoes\nare wound up as high and insolent as ever they were.\n\nDaup:\nYou jest.\n\nCler:\nNo drunkards, either with wine or vanity, ever confess'd\nsuch stories of themselves. I would not give a fly's leg, in\nbalance against all the womens' reputations here, if they could\nbe but thought to speak truth: and for the bride, they have made\ntheir affidavit against her directly\u2014\n\nDaup:\nWhat, that they have lain with her?\n\nCler:\nYes; and tell times and circumstances, with the cause why,\nand the place where. I had almost brought them to affirm that they\nhad done it to-day.\n\nDaup:\nNot both of them?\n\nCler:\nYes, faith: with a sooth or two more I had effected it.\nThey would have set it down under their hands.\n\nDaup:\nWhy, they will be our sport, I see, still, whether we will\nor no.\n\n[ENTER TRUEWIT.]\n\nTrue:\nO, are you here? Come, Dauphine; go call your uncle\npresently: I have fitted my divine, and my canonist, dyed\ntheir beards and all. The knaves do not know themselves, they\nare so exalted and altered. Preferment changes any man. Thou\nshalt keep one door and I another, and then Clerimont in the\nmidst, that he may have no means of escape from their cavilling,\nwhen they grow hot once again. And then the women, as I have\ngiven the bride her instructions, to break in upon him in the\nl'enuoy. O, 'twill be full and twanging! Away! fetch him.\n\n[EXIT DAUPHINE.]\n\n[ENTER OTTER DISGUISED AS A DIVINE, AND CUTBEARD AS A CANON LAWYER.]\n\nCome, master doctor, and master parson, look to your parts now,\nand discharge them bravely: you are well set forth, perform it\nas well. If you chance to be out, do not confess it with standing\nstill, or humming, or gaping one at another: but go on, and talk\naloud and eagerly; use vehement action, and only remember your\nterms, and you are safe. Let the matter go where it will: you\nhave many will do so. But at first be very solemn, and grave like\nyour garments, though you loose your selves after, and skip out\nlike a brace of jugglers on a table. Here he comes: set your\nfaces, and look superciliously, while I present you.\n\n[RE-ENTER DAUPHINE WITH MOROSE.]\n\nMor:\nAre these the two learned men?\n\nTrue:\nYes, sir; please you salute them.\n\nMor:\nSalute them! I had rather do any thing, than wear out time so\nunfruitfully, sir. I wonder how these common forms, as God save\nyou, and You are welcome, are come to be a habit in our lives:\nor, I am glad to see you! when I cannot see what the profit can\nbe of these words, so long as it is no whit better with him whose\naffairs are sad and grievous, that he hears this salutation.\n\nTrue:\n'Tis true, sir; we'll go to the matter then.\u2014Gentlemen,\nmaster doctor, and master parson, I have acquainted you\nsufficiently with the business for which you are come hither; and\nyou are not now to inform yourselves in the state of the question,\nI know. This is the gentleman who expects your resolution, and\ntherefore, when you please, begin.\n\nOtt:\nPlease you, master doctor.\n\nCut:\nPlease you, good master parson.\n\nOtt:\nI would hear the canon-law speak first.\n\nCut:\nIt must give place to positive divinity, sir.\n\nMor:\nNay, good gentlemen, do not throw me into circumstances. Let\nyour comforts arrive quickly at me, those that are. Be swift in\naffording me my peace, if so I shall hope any. I love not your\ndisputations, or your court-tumults. And that it be not strange to\nyou, I will tell you: My father, in my education, was wont to\nadvise me, that I should always collect and contain my mind, not\nsuffering it to flow loosely; that I should look to what things\nwere necessary to the carriage of my life, and what not; embracing\nthe one and eschewing the other: in short, that I should endear\nmyself to rest, and avoid turmoil: which now is grown to be\nanother nature to me. So that I come not to your public pleadings,\nor your places of noise; not that I neglect those things that make\nfor the dignity of the commonwealth: but for the mere avoiding\nof clamours and impertinencies of orators, that know not how to be silent. And for the cause of noise, am I now a suitor to you. You\ndo not know in what a misery I have been exercised this day, what\na torrent of evil! my very house turns round with the tumult! I\ndwell in a windmill: The perpetual motion is here, and not at\nEltham.\n\nTrue:\nWell, good master doctor, will you break the ice? master\nparson will wade after.\n\nCut:\nSir, though unworthy, and the weaker, I will presume.\n\nOtt:\n'Tis no presumption, domine doctor.\n\nMor:\nYet again!\n\nCut:\nYour question is, For how many causes a man may have\ndivortium legitimum, a lawful divorce? First, you must understand\nthe nature of the word, divorce, a divertendo\u2014\n\nMor:\nNo excursions upon words, good doctor, to the question briefly.\n\nCut:\nI answer then, the canon-law affords divorce but in a few\ncases; and the principal is in the common case, the adulterous\ncase: But there are duodecim impedimenta, twelve impediments, as we call them, all which do not dirimere contractum, but irritum\nreddere matrimonium, as we say in the canon-law, not take away the bond, but cause a nullity therein.\n\nMor:\nI understood you before: good sir, avoid your impertinency of\ntranslation.\n\nOtt:\nHe cannot open this too much, sir, by your favour.\n\nMor:\nYet more!\n\nTrue:\nO, you must give the learned men leave, sir.\u2014To your\nimpediments, master Doctor.\n\nCut:\nThe first is impedimentum erroris.\n\nOtt:\nOf which there are several species.\n\nCut:\nAy, as error personae.\n\nOtt:\nIf you contract yourself to one person, thinking her another.\n\nCut:\nThen, error fortunae.\n\nOtt:\nIf she be a begger, and you thought her rich.\n\nCut:\nThen, error qualitatis.\n\nOtt:\nIf she prove stubborn or head-strong, that you thought\nobedient.\n\nMor:\nHow! is that, sir, a lawful impediment? One at once, I pray\nyou gentlemen.\n\nOtt:\nAy, ante copulam, but not post copulam, sir.\n\nCut:\nMaster Parson says right. Nec post nuptiarum benedictionem.\nIt doth indeed but irrita reddere sponsalia, annul the contract:\nafter marriage it is of no obstancy.\n\nTrue:\nAlas, sir, what a hope are we fallen from by this time!\n\nCut:\nThe next is conditio: if you thought her free born, and she\nprove a bond-woman, there is impediment of estate and condition.\n\nOtt:\nAy, but, master doctor, those servitudes are sublatae now,\namong us Christians.\n\nCut:\nBy your favour, master parson\u2014\n\nOtt:\nYou shall give me leave, master doctor.\n\nMor:\nNay, gentlemen, quarrel not in that question; it concerns not\nmy case: pass to the third.\n\nCut:\nWell then, the third is votum: if either party have made a\nvow of chastity. But that practice, as master parson said of the\nother, is taken away among us, thanks be to discipline. The fourth\nis cognatio: if the persons be of kin within the degrees.\n\nOtt:\nAy: do you know what the degrees are, sir?\n\nMor:\nNo, nor I care not, sir: they offer me no comfort in the\nquestion, I am sure.\n\nCut:\nBut there is a branch of this impediment may, which is\ncognatio spiritualis: if you were her godfather, sir, then the\nmarriage is incestuous.\n\nOtt:\nThat comment is absurd and superstitious, master doctor: I\ncannot endure it. Are we not all brothers and sisters, and as much\nakin in that, as godfathers and god-daughters?\n\nMor:\nO me! to end the controversy, I never was a godfather, I\nnever was a godfather in my life, sir. Pass to the next.\n\nCut:\nThe fifth is crimen adulterii; the known case. The sixth,\ncultus disparitas, difference of religion: have you ever examined\nher, what religion she is of?\n\nMor:\nNo, I would rather she were of none, than be put to the\ntrouble of it!\n\nOtt:\nYou may have it done for you, sir.\n\nMor:\nBy no means, good sir; on to the rest: shall you ever come\nto an end, think you?\n\nTrue:\nYes, he has done half, sir. On, to the rest.\u2014Be patient,\nand expect, sir.\n\nCut:\nThe seventh is, vis: if it were upon compulsion or force.\n\nMor:\nO no, it was too voluntary, mine; too voluntary.\n\nCut:\nThe eight is, ordo; if ever she have taken holy orders.\n\nOtt:\nThat's supersitious too.\n\nMor:\nNo matter, master parson: Would she would go into a nunnery\nyet.\n\nCut:\nThe ninth is, ligamen; if you were bound, sir, to any other\nbefore.\n\nMor:\nI thrust myself too soon into these fetters.\n\nCut:\nThe tenth is, publica honestas: which is inchoata quaedam\naffinitas.\n\nOtt:\nAy, or affinitas orta ex sponsalibus; and is but leve\nimpedimentum.\n\nMor:\nI feel no air of comfort blowing to me, in all this.\n\nCut:\nThe eleventh is, affinitas ex fornicatione.\n\nOtt:\nWhich is no less vera affinitas, than the other, master\ndoctor.\n\nCut:\nTrue, quae oritur ex legitimo matrimonio.\n\nOtt:\nYou say right, venerable doctor: and, nascitur ex eo, quod\nper conjugium duae personae efficiuntur una caro\u2014\n\nMor:\nHey-day, now they begin!\n\nCut:\nI conceive you, master parson: ita per fornicationem aeque\nest verus pater, qui sic generat\u2014\n\nOtt:\nEt vere filius qui sic generatur\u2014\n\nMor:\nWhat's all this to me?\n\nCler:\nNow it grows warm.\n\nCut:\nThe twelfth, and last is, si forte coire nequibis.\n\nOtt:\nAy, that is impedimentum gravissimum: it doth utterly annul,\nand annihilate, that. If you have manifestam frigiditatem, you\nare well, sir.\n\nTrue:\nWhy, there is comfort come at length, sir. Confess yourself\nbut a man unable, and she will sue to be divorced first.\n\nOtt:\nAy, or if there be morbus perpetuus, et insanabilis; as\nparalysis, elephantiasis, or so\u2014\n\nDaup:\nO, but frigiditas is the fairer way, gentlemen.\n\nOtt:\nYou say troth, sir, and as it is in the canon, master\ndoctor\u2014\n\nCut:\nI conceive you, sir.\n\nCler:\nBefore he speaks!\n\nOtt:\nThat a boy, or child, under years, is not fit for marriage,\nbecause he cannot reddere debitum. So your omnipotentes\u2014\n\nTrue [ASIDE TO OTT.]:\nYour impotentes, you whoreson lobster!\n\nOtt:\nYour impotentes, I should say, are minime apti ad\ncontrahenda matrimonium.\n\nTrue:\nMatrimonium! we shall have most unmatrimonial Latin with\nyou: matrimonia, and be hang'd.\n\nDaup:\nYou put them out, man.\n\nCut:\nBut then there will arise a doubt, master parson, in our\ncase, post matrimonium: that frigiditate praeditus\u2014do you\nconceive me, sir?\n\nOtt:\nVery well, sir.\n\nCut:\nWho cannot uti uxore pro uxore, may habere eam pro sorore.\n\nOtt:\nAbsurd, absurd, absurd, and merely apostatical!\n\nCut:\nYou shall pardon me, master parson, I can prove it.\n\nOtt:\nYou can prove a will, master doctor, you can prove nothing\nelse. Does not the verse of your own canon say,\nHaec socianda vetant connubia, facta retractant?\n\nCut:\nI grant you; but how do they retractare, master parson?\n\nMor:\nO, this was it I feared.\n\nOtt:\nIn aeternum, sir.\n\nCut:\nThat's false in divinity, by your favour.\n\nOtt:\n'Tis false in humanity to say so. Is he not prorsus inutilis\nad thorum? Can he praestare fidem datam?
