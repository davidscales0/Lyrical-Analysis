no not this time\nCycles on cycles\nIt's like an amphetamine\nHow it marinate on my mind\nStuck on me, yah\nGot no doubt I'll be alright\nIf I just make it through the night\n\n[Verse]\nPass me the amphetamine\nRight now can't focus on anything\nWhy they take lil' bro instead of me?\nI hurt when you hurt, we was siamese\nNiggas was seventeen, when I found out what that cheddar mean\nRats'll bite holes through the wall to get close\nWatch for their trail, man they always be close\nI'm a Back-a-wood roller, really a smoker\nThis louder than when you drive on the shoulder\nStomp on the gas 'til I'm blowin' the motor\nCan't 'ford to sit with my thoughts or it's over\nReally but luckily, I got a real one, she fuck wit me\nShawty, she yellow, yeah keep me on my toes, stay mellow\nShe deserve a fucking ring\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nI'm off the sedatives\nAmphetamine\nI don't know where I'm headed\nDon't know where I'm headed\nSedatives\nAmphetamine\nSedatives\nI don't know where I'm headed\nDon't know where I'm headed\n\n[Chorus]\nMoonlight disrupt the day\nBeen like this every night\nWalking in stumbling\nFucked up some bread today\nThough I said no no not this time\nCycles on cycles\nIt's like an amphetamine\nHow it marinate on my mind\nStuck on me, yah\nGot no doubt I'll be alright\nIf I just make it through the night\nMoonlight disrupt the day\nBeen like this every night\nWalking in stumbling\nFucked up some bread today\nThough I said no no not this time\nCycles on cycles\nIt's like an amphetamine\nHow it marinate on my mind\nStuck on me, yah\nGot no doubt I'll be alright\nIf I just make it through the night\n[Bridge]\nI'm off the sedatives\nAmphetamine\nI don't know where I'm headed\nDon't know where I'm headed\nSedatives\nAmphetamine\nSedatives\nI don't know where I'm headed\nDon't know where I'm headed\nNo\n\n[Part II: Krash Kourse]\n\n[Intro]\nGod damn, Phoe'\nSwn, swn, swn, swn, swn\n\n[Verse 1: Smino]\nAy, krash kourse into the world, this insular world\nThe culture vultures flock in every sense of the word\nMy nose can sniff the shit out but I'm never deterred\nNever be scurred, scored through the downs, first and third\nGrandaddy spittin, ain't nothing new bout the system\n'Cause how they do me they did him\nAppropriating the fellas, sucking the fruit from my elders\nDon't give a Chuck bout no Berry, they rather listen to Elvis\nWoah, mama, and these kids know better, uh\nI'm grand like abuela, uh, more hands than Coachella, uh\nLil hoe it's whatever, uh\nShawty cold as December, I still fold her, no Manila\nB-b-b-bear wit me, baby, I hibernate, smoke the lettuce\nNo niggas jammed off the reggie\nFree all my dogs, fuck Cruella\nNigga need cream, vanilla, ele-vate\nCoconut Beamer, oiled up, switching lanes\nChocolate interior, that's a bellyache\n[Chorus: Bari]\nI done went Murda Mike, on the may-a-ooo, uh\nShe on the payroll, he on the payroll\nI want the queso, I want the caseload\nShe do what I say so, now\nShe fucked up, yeah, she might do the Fabo\nSend that RIP, out yeah, and that shit for Shawty Lo\nBack when I was broke I had to pour that Bacardi slow\nNow I'm on the board, niggas salty like margaritas, ooh\nI used to dream about the coupe, baby\nNow I'm thinking bout when it was me and you, baby\nYeah, used to dream about the coupe, baby\nNow I think of me and you\n\n[Verse 2: Jean Deaux]\nI don't know what's better, I won't say what's worse\nPen is like a needle when I bleed these words\nI could make a blessing if I spit this verse\nThat's why I be retching 'til I rid my curse\nBlack it be the sweetest, secrecy up in the frequencies\nThat's why you feel the need to look at me like I'm a deity\nDuality is key, you see, that I'm seein' you seein' me\nSo now we seeing equally, and that don't happen easily\nNeedlessly to say, I hate that we're meeting this way\nFeel like I packed up to go 'bout a week ago, I don't know\nIf I switch up my flow I might tap into the pinnacles\nI'm sellin' syllables, I'm losing principles\nLurkin', searching for miracles, hurtin' workmen, curtain closed\nEarn a million dollars just to owe it to some imbeciles\nIf they tell me no, I be dumb, all I hear is go\nCrossfire coming but I'm pigeon-toed, winter froze\n\n[Chorus: Bari]\nI done went Murda Mike, on the may-a-ooo, uh\nShe on the payroll, he on the payroll\nI want the queso, I want the caseload\nShe do what I say so, now\nShe fucked up, yeah, she might do the Fabo\nSend that RIP out yeah, and that shit for Shawty Lo\nBack when I was broke I had to pour that Bacardi slow\nNow I'm on the board, niggas salty like margaritas, ooh\nI used to dream about the coupe, baby\nNow I'm thinking bout when it was me and you, baby\nYeah, used to dream about the coupe, baby\nNow I think of me and you\n\n[Bridge: Smino]\nCunning linguistics, punishing puns\nPumping the petrol, gas in my lungs\nLoving the low times, higher than a mug\nUp in the cabinet\nImagine a baby reaching his hands up to grab it\nA pipe done busted in heaven\nAnd got to leaking out blessings\nReaching my hands up to grab it\nRe'in my bands up, uh, uh\n\n[Verse 3: Noname]\nSunny metropolis, overzealous as telefone\nTelefone a new continent, maybe rode me a rocketship\nCopper all on my dash, and he ticket that lady optimist\nSaid I'm moving too fast, slow down, slow down\nOpened up for Lauryn Hill, woah now, woah now, woah now\nEverything is everything and the object steady mystified\nMy allegories underneath the rock will only fear resides\nI bet I'm gon' find it, I know I'm gon' find it\nHappiness, bank account, white accountant, I found the fountain\nI was born in all black, how could God denounce this?\nI told Him, 'Give me my money, I need my money now'\nThank you Jesus, whoever you are\nI know you gifted me the gift of gab and simile\nAnd simpleness, the solitude is loneliness, been good to me\nI told them, 'Give me my happy, I need my holy now'\nThank you Jesus, whoever you are\nThank you Jesus, whoever you are29Embed"
