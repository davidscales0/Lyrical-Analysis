I need this money man\nGet up out in these, in these streets man\nYo, so what's the deal God?\nI'm sayin, what you need though?\nYo let me have like, two or three, three G's man\nI'm sayin, I'm sayin son man\nYou know what happened last time though\nI gotta do what I gotta do man, I gotta eat man\nWhassup man? Oh your baby momma stressin you?\n\n[Verse 1]\nWay past the days of the deuce me and you stays a crew\nOnly a few percent knew what me and you went through\nWe've been sent to dominate, these corny come-lates\nAnd set this crooked rap shit straight from Crenshaw to Castlegate\nLike Pete and CL, I reminisce over days\nFrom the streets of Boston to New York and all the ways\nFor certain niggas to blow up, and crime paid\nBut my praise goes to the most high\nCause some nights I got so wild yo, I almost died\nSome stuff I got into, really scarred my mental\nPops wasn't tryin to hear it, cause of what he been through\nStill, like my nigga Havoc said, sometimes you gotta\nHit your crew off, so they can make some bread\nCause no matter the weather, niggas be needin cheddar\nAnd things in this world are more fucked up than ever\nSo let's make this bond to keep this hip-hop strong\nYou a man Baby Pop you know right from wrong\nSo stay out of trouble, and that goes for me too\nThat's what we need to do, that's my advice to you...\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nYou remember what happened last time, when you got knocked\nDoin your thing, sewin shit up on the block\nYou need to stop, fore you get caught again\nOr you get shot and I lose another friend\n\n\"Any man with the plan is precise with his life\"\n\n\"Think twice\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy advice to you, cut down on champagne and booze\nFor a nigga like me, most time that shit's bad news\nIt's like lightin a fuse whether it's sneakers or shoes\nCause somebody always wanna step up to start a feud\nIt's like Set-tin It Off but not the movie\nPlus let's get some real women forget floozies and the groupies\nCause they spell mad problems from Watts to Harlem\nAnd the bullshit won't stop long as the world's revolvin\nAnd I recall when niggas knew my pops had clout\nBut they didn't know my sorry ass was gettin kicked out\nAnd they was seein if I wanted to come bubble with them\nAnd make my ends triple and double with them\nAnd get in trouble with them, now memories of them\nI wear em in my heart like a emblem\nI doubt we'd ever be bigtime sellin dope coke or dust\nIt's killin us, let's take our people and make a exodus\nAnnhilation, inhalation through the lungs\nOr extermination, by the use of dirty guns\nTriple beam dreams and drug schemes of mad cream\nCould be a sad scene when you go to that extreme\n\"Any man with the plan is precise with his life\"\n\n\"Think twice\"\n\n\"My advice is to you...\"12Embed"
