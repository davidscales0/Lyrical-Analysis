Where is happiness?\nWhat is life? Where is peace?\nWhen will I find the strength to bring me release?\n\n[Verse 3]\nTell me where is the love in what your prophet has said?\nMan, it sounds to me just like a prison for the walking dead\nAnd I've got a message for you and your twisted hell\nYou better turn around and blow your kiss goodbye to life eternal, angel, yeah\n\n[Outro]\nAngel\nYeah, angel\nOoh, God, yeah\nOoh5Embed"
