Please be seated.\n\nI have to say that it is one of the great honors of my life to be able to address this gathering here today. I want to thank Dr. Wilson for his outstanding leadership, and the Board of Trustees. We have Congressman Cedric Richmond and Sanford Bishop \u2014 both proud alumni of this school, as well as Congressman Hank Johnson. And one of my dear friends and a great inspiration to us all \u2014 the great John Lewis is here. (Applause.) We have your outstanding Mayor, Mr. Kasim Reed, in the house. (Applause.)\n\nTo all the members of the Morehouse family. And most of all, congratulations to this distinguished group of Morehouse Men \u2014 the Class of 2013. (Applause.)\n\nI have to say that it\u2019s a little hard to follow \u2014 not Dr. Wilson, but a skinny guy with a funny name. (Laughter.) Betsegaw Tadele \u2014 he\u2019s going to be doing something.\n\nI also have to say that you all are going to get wet. (Laughter.) And I\u2019d be out there with you if I could. (Laughter.) But Secret Service gets nervous. (Laughter.) So I\u2019m going to have to stay here, dry. (Laughter.) But know that I\u2019m there with you in spirit. (Laughter.)\n\nSome of you are graduating summa cum laude. (Applause.) Some of you are graduating magna cum laude. (Applause.) I know some of you are just graduating, \u201cthank you, Lordy.\u201d (Laughter and applause.) That\u2019s appropriate because it\u2019s a Sunday. (Laughter.)\n\nI see some moms and grandmas here, aunts, in their Sunday best \u2014 although they are upset about their hair getting messed up. (Laughter.) Michelle would not be sitting in the rain. (Laughter.) She has taught me about hair. (Laughter.)\n\nI want to congratulate all of you \u2014 the parents, the grandparents, the brothers and sisters, the family and friends who supported these young men in so many ways. This is your day, as well. Just think about it \u2014 your sons, your brothers, your nephews \u2014 they spent the last four years far from home and close to Spelman, and yet they are still here today. (Applause.) So you\u2019ve done something right. Graduates, give a big round of applause to your family for everything that they\u2019ve done for you. (Applause.)\n\nI know that some of you had to wait in long lines to get into today\u2019s ceremony. And I would apologize, but it did not have anything to do with security. Those graduates just wanted you to know what it\u2019s like to register for classes here. (Laughter and applause.) And this time of year brings a different kind of stress \u2014 every senior stopping by Gloster Hall over the past week making sure your name was actually on the list of students who met all the graduation requirements. (Applause.) If it wasn\u2019t on the list, you had to figure out why. Was it that library book you lent to that trifling roommate who didn\u2019t return it? (Laughter.) Was it Dr. Johnson\u2019s policy class? (Applause.) Did you get enough Crown Forum credits? (Applause.)\n\nOn that last point, I\u2019m going to exercise my power as President to declare this speech sufficient Crown Forum credits for any otherwise eligible student to graduate. That is my graduation gift to you. (Applause.) You have a special dispensation.\n\nNow, graduates, I am humbled to stand here with all of you as an honorary Morehouse Man. (Applause.) I finally made it. (Laughter.) And as I do, I\u2019m mindful of an old saying: \u201cYou can always tell a Morehouse Man \u2014 (applause) \u2014 but you can\u2019t tell him much.\u201d (Applause.) And that makes my task a little more difficult, I suppose. But I think it also reflects the sense of pride that\u2019s always been part of this school\u2019s tradition.\n\nBenjamin Mays, who served as the president of Morehouse for almost 30 years, understood that tradition better than anybody. He said \u2014 and I quote \u2014 \u201cIt will not be sufficient for Morehouse College, for any college, for that matter, to produce clever graduates \u2014 but rather honest men, men who can be trusted in public and private life \u2014 men who are sensitive to the wrongs, the sufferings, and the injustices of society and who are willing to accept responsibility for correcting (those) ills.\u201d\n\nIt was that mission \u2014 not just to educate men, but to cultivate good men, strong men, upright men \u2014 that brought community leaders together just two years after the end of the Civil War. They assembled a list of 37 men, free blacks and freed slaves, who would make up the first prospective class of what later became Morehouse College. Most of those first students had a desire to become teachers and preachers \u2014 to better themselves so they could help others do the same.\nA century and a half later, times have changed. But the \u201cMorehouse Mystique\u201d still endures. Some of you probably came here from communities where everybody looked like you. Others may have come here in search of a community. And I suspect that some of you probably felt a little bit of culture shock the first time you came together as a class in King\u2019s Chapel. All of a sudden, you weren\u2019t the only high school sports captain, you weren\u2019t the only student council president. You were suddenly in a group of high achievers, and that meant you were expected to do something more.\n\nThat\u2019s the unique sense of purpose that this place has always infused \u2014 the conviction that this is a training ground not only for individual success, but for leadership that can change the world.\n\nDr. King was just 15 years old when he enrolled here at Morehouse. He was an unknown, undersized, unassuming young freshman who lived at home with his parents. And I think it\u2019s fair to say he wasn\u2019t the coolest kid on campus \u2014 for the suits he wore, his classmates called him \u201cTweed.\u201d But his education at Morehouse helped to forge the intellect, the discipline, the compassion, the soul force that would transform America. It was here that he was introduced to the writings of Gandhi and Thoreau, and the theory of civil disobedience. It was here that professors encouraged him to look past the world as it was and fight for the world as it should be. And it was here, at Morehouse, as Dr. King later wrote, where \u201cI realized that nobody \u2014 was afraid.\u201d\n\nNot even of some bad weather. I added on that part. (Laughter.) I know it\u2019s wet out there. But Dr. Wilson told me you all had a choice and decided to do it out here anyway. (Applause.) That\u2019s a Morehouse Man talking.\n\nNow, think about it. For black men in the \u201940s and the \u201950s, the threat of violence, the constant humiliations, large and small, the uncertainty that you could support a family, the gnawing doubts born of the Jim Crow culture that told you every day that somehow you were inferior, the temptation to shrink from the world, to accept your place, to avoid risks, to be afraid \u2014 that temptation was necessarily strong.\n\nAnd yet, here, under the tutelage of men like Dr. Mays, young Martin learned to be unafraid. And he, in turn, taught others to be unafraid. And over time, he taught a nation to be unafraid. And over the last 50 years, thanks to the moral force of Dr. King and a Moses generation that overcame their fear and their cynicism and their despair, barriers have come tumbling down, and new doors of opportunity have swung open, and laws and hearts and minds have been changed to the point where someone who looks just like you can somehow come to serve as President of these United States of America. (Applause.)\n\nSo the history we share should give you hope. The future we share should give you hope. You\u2019re graduating into an improving job market. You\u2019re living in a time when advances in technology and communication put the world at your fingertips. Your generation is uniquely poised for success unlike any generation of African Americans that came before it.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have work \u2014 because if we\u2019re honest with ourselves, we know that too few of our brothers have the opportunities that you\u2019ve had here at Morehouse.\n\nIn troubled neighborhoods all across this country \u2014 many of them heavily African American \u2014 too few of our citizens have role models to guide them. Communities just a couple miles from my house in Chicago, communities just a couple miles from here \u2014 they\u2019re places where jobs are still too scarce and wages are still too low; where schools are underfunded and violence is pervasive; where too many of our men spend their youth not behind a desk in a classroom, but hanging out on the streets or brooding behind a jail cell.\n\nMy job, as President, is to advocate for policies that generate more opportunity for everybody \u2014 policies that strengthen the middle class and give more people the chance to climb their way into the middle class. Policies that create more good jobs and reduce poverty, and educate more children, and give more families the security of health care, and protect more of our children from the horrors of gun violence. That\u2019s my job. Those are matters of public policy, and it is important for all of us \u2014 black, white and brown \u2014 to advocate for an America where everybody has got a fair shot in life. Not just some. Not just a few. (Applause.)\n\nBut along with collective responsibilities, we have individual responsibilities. There are some things, as black men, we can only do for ourselves. There are some things, as Morehouse Men, that you are obliged to do for those still left behind. As Morehouse Men, you now wield something even more powerful than the diploma you\u2019re about to collect \u2014 and that\u2019s the power of your example.\n\nSo what I ask of you today is the same thing I ask of every graduating class I address: Use that power for something larger than yourself. Live up to President Mays\u2019s challenge. Be \u201csensitive to the wrongs, the sufferings, and the injustices of society.\u201d And be \u201cwilling to accept responsibility for correcting (those) ills.\u201d\n\nI know that some of you came to Morehouse from communities where life was about keeping your head down and looking out for yourself. Maybe you feel like you escaped, and now you can take your degree and get that fancy job and the nice house and the nice car \u2014 and never look back. And don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 with all those student loans you\u2019ve had to take out, I know you\u2019ve got to earn some money. With doors open to you that your parents and grandparents could not even imagine, no one expects you to take a vow of poverty. But I will say it betrays a poverty of ambition if all you think about is what goods you can buy instead of what good you can do. (Applause.)\nSo, yes, go get that law degree. But if you do, ask yourself if the only option is to defend the rich and the powerful, or if you can also find some time to defend the powerless. Sure, go get your MBA, or start that business. We need black businesses out there. But ask yourselves what broader purpose your business might serve, in putting people to work, or transforming a neighborhood. The most successful CEOs I know didn\u2019t start out intent just on making money \u2014 rather, they had a vision of how their product or service would change things, and the money followed. (Applause.)\n\nSome of you may be headed to medical school to become doctors. But make sure you heal folks in underserved communities who really need it, too. For generations, certain groups in this country \u2014 especially African Americans \u2014 have been desperate in need of access to quality, affordable health care. And as a society, we\u2019re finally beginning to change that. Those of you who are under the age of 26 already have the option to stay on your parent\u2019s health care plan. But all of you are heading into an economy where many young people expect not only to have multiple jobs, but multiple careers.\n\nSo starting October 1st, because of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 otherwise known as Obamacare \u2014 (applause) \u2014 you\u2019ll be able to shop for a quality, affordable plan that\u2019s yours and travels with you \u2014 a plan that will insure not only your health, but your dreams if you are sick or get in an accident. But we\u2019re going to need some doctors to make sure it works, too. We\u2019ve got to make sure everybody has good health in this country. It\u2019s not just good for you, it\u2019s good for this country. So you\u2019re going to have to spread the word to your fellow young people.\n\nWhich brings me to a second point: Just as Morehouse has taught you to expect more of yourselves, inspire those who look up to you to expect more of themselves. We know that too many young men in our community continue to make bad choices. And I have to say, growing up, I made quite a few myself. Sometimes I wrote off my own failings as just another example of the world trying to keep a black man down. I had a tendency sometimes to make excuses for me not doing the right thing. But one of the things that all of you have learned over the last four years is there\u2019s no longer any room for excuses. (Applause.)\n\nI understand there\u2019s a common fraternity creed here at Morehouse: \u201cExcuses are tools of the incompetent used to build bridges to nowhere and monuments of nothingness.\u201d Well, we\u2019ve got no time for excuses. Not because the bitter legacy of slavery and segregation have vanished entirely; they have not. Not because racism and discrimination no longer exist; we know those are still out there. It\u2019s just that in today\u2019s hyperconnected, hypercompetitive world, with millions of young people from China and India and Brazil \u2014 many of whom started with a whole lot less than all of you did \u2014 all of them entering the global workforce alongside you, nobody is going to give you anything that you have not earned. (Applause.)\n\nNobody cares how tough your upbringing was. Nobody cares if you suffered some discrimination. And moreover, you have to remember that whatever you\u2019ve gone through, it pales in comparison to the hardships previous generations endured \u2014 and they overcame them. And if they overcame them, you can overcome them, too. (Applause.)\n\nYou now hail from a lineage and legacy of immeasurably strong men \u2014 men who bore tremendous burdens and still laid the stones for the path on which we now walk. You wear the mantle of Frederick Douglass and Booker T. Washington, and Ralph Bunche and Langston Hughes, and George Washington Carver and Ralph Abernathy and Thurgood Marshall, and, yes, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. These men were many things to many people. And they knew full well the role that racism played in their lives. But when it came to their own accomplishments and sense of purpose, they had no time for excuses.\n\nEvery one of you have a grandma or an uncle or a parent who\u2019s told you that at some point in life, as an African American, you have to work twice as hard as anyone else if you want to get by. I think President Mays put it even better: He said, \u201cWhatever you do, strive to do it so well that no man living and no man dead, and no man yet to be born can do it any better.\u201d (Applause.)\n\nAnd I promise you, what was needed in Dr. Mays\u2019s time, that spirit of excellence, and hard work, and dedication, and no excuses is needed now more than ever. If you think you can just get over in this economy just because you have a Morehouse degree, you\u2019re in for a rude awakening. But if you stay hungry, if you keep hustling, if you keep on your grind and get other folks to do the same \u2014 nobody can stop you. (Applause.)\n\nAnd when I talk about pursuing excellence and setting an example, I\u2019m not just talking about in your professional life. One of today\u2019s graduates, Frederick Anderson \u2014 where\u2019s Frederick? Frederick, right here. (Applause.) I know it\u2019s raining, but I\u2019m going to tell about Frederick. Frederick started his college career in Ohio, only to find out that his high school sweetheart back in Georgia was pregnant. So he came back and enrolled in Morehouse to be closer to her. Pretty soon, helping raise a newborn and working night shifts became too much, so he started taking business classes at a technical college instead \u2014 doing everything from delivering newspapers to buffing hospital floors to support his family.\n\nAnd then he enrolled at Morehouse a second time. But even with a job, he couldn\u2019t keep up with the cost of tuition. So after getting his degree from that technical school, this father of three decided to come back to Morehouse for a third time. (Applause.) As Frederick says, \u201cGod has a plan for my life, and He\u2019s not done with me yet.\u201d\n\nAnd today, Frederick is a family man, and a working man, and a Morehouse Man. (Applause.) And that\u2019s what I\u2019m asking all of you to do: Keep setting an example for what it means to be a man. (Applause.) Be the best husband to your wife, or you\u2019re your boyfriend, or your partner. Be the best father you can be to your children. Because nothing is more important.\n\nI was raised by a heroic single mom, wonderful grandparents \u2014 made incredible sacrifices for me. And I know there are moms and grandparents here today who did the same thing for all of you. But I sure wish I had had a father who was not only present, but involved.\nDidn\u2019t know my dad. And so my whole life, I\u2019ve tried to be for Michelle and my girls what my father was not for my mother and me. I want to break that cycle where a father is not at home \u2014 (applause) \u2014 where a father is not helping to raise that son or daughter. I want to be a better father, a better husband, a better man.\n\nIt\u2019s hard work that demands your constant attention and frequent sacrifice. And I promise you, Michelle will tell you I\u2019m not perfect. She\u2019s got a long list of my imperfections. (Laughter.) Even now, I\u2019m still practicing, I\u2019m still learning, still getting corrected in terms of how to be a fine husband and a good father. But I will tell you this: Everything else is unfulfilled if we fail at family, if we fail at that responsibility. (Applause.)\n\nI know that when I am on my deathbed someday, I will not be thinking about any particular legislation I passed; I will not be thinking about a policy I promoted; I will not be thinking about the speech I gave, I will not be thinking the Nobel Prize I received. I will be thinking about that walk I took with my daughters. I\u2019ll be thinking about a lazy afternoon with my wife. I\u2019ll be thinking about sitting around the dinner table and seeing them happy and healthy and knowing that they were loved. And I\u2019ll be thinking about whether I did right by all of them.\n\nSo be a good role model, set a good example for that young brother coming up. If you know somebody who\u2019s not on point, go back and bring that brother along \u2014 those who\u2019ve been left behind, who haven\u2019t had the same opportunities we have \u2014 they need to hear from you. You\u2019ve got to be engaged on the barbershops, on the basketball court, at church, spend time and energy and presence to give people opportunities and a chance. Pull them up, expose them, support their dreams. Don\u2019t put them down.\n\nWe\u2019ve got to teach them just like what we have to learn, what it means to be a man \u2014 to serve your city like Maynard Jackson; to shape the culture like Spike Lee; to be like Chester Davenport, one of the first people to integrate the University of Georgia Law School. When he got there, nobody would sit next to him in class. But Chester didn\u2019t mind. Later on, he said, \u201cIt was the thing for me to do. Someone needed to be the first.\u201d And today, Chester is here celebrating his 50th reunion. Where is Chester Davenport? He\u2019s here. (Applause.)\n\nSo if you\u2019ve had role models, fathers, brothers like that \u2014 thank them today. And if you haven\u2019t, commit yourself to being that man to somebody else.\n\nAnd finally, as you do these things, do them not just for yourself, but don\u2019t even do them just for the African American community. I want you to set your sights higher. At the turn of the last century, W.E.B. DuBois spoke about the \u201ctalented tenth\u201d \u2014 a class of highly educated, socially conscious leaders in the black community. But it\u2019s not just the African American community that needs you. The country needs you. The world needs you.\n\nAs Morehouse Men, many of you know what it\u2019s like to be an outsider; know what it\u2019s like to be marginalized; know what it\u2019s like to feel the sting of discrimination. And that\u2019s an experience that a lot of Americans share. Hispanic Americans know that feeling when somebody asks them where they come from or tell them to go back. Gay and lesbian Americans feel it when a stranger passes judgment on their parenting skills or the love that they share. Muslim Americans feel it when they\u2019re stared at with suspicion because of their faith. Any woman who knows the injustice of earning less pay for doing the same work \u2014 she knows what it\u2019s like to be on the outside looking in.\n\nSo your experiences give you special insight that today\u2019s leaders need. If you tap into that experience, it should endow you with empathy \u2014 the understanding of what it\u2019s like to walk in somebody else\u2019s shoes, to see through their eyes, to know what it\u2019s like when you\u2019re not born on 3rd base, thinking you hit a triple. It should give you the ability to connect. It should give you a sense of compassion and what it means to overcome barriers.\n\nAnd I will tell you, Class of 2013, whatever success I have achieved, whatever positions of leadership I have held have depended less on Ivy League degrees or SAT scores or GPAs, and have instead been due to that sense of connection and empathy \u2014 the special obligation I felt, as a black man like you, to help those who need it most, people who didn\u2019t have the opportunities that I had \u2014 because there but for the grace of God, go I \u2014 I might have been in their shoes. I might have been in prison. I might have been unemployed. I might not have been able to support a family. And that motivates me. (Applause.)\n\nSo it\u2019s up to you to widen your circle of concern \u2014 to care about justice for everybody, white, black and brown. Everybody. Not just in your own community, but also across this country and around the world. To make sure everyone has a voice, and everybody gets a seat at the table; that everybody, no matter what you look like or where you come from, what your last name is \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter, everybody gets a chance to walk through those doors of opportunity if they are willing to work hard enough.\n\nWhen Leland Shelton was four years old \u2014 where\u2019s Leland? (Applause.) Stand up, Leland. When Leland Shelton was four years old, social services took him away from his mama, put him in the care of his grandparents. By age 14, he was in the foster care system. Three years after that, Leland enrolled in Morehouse. And today he is graduating Phi Beta Kappa on his way to Harvard Law School. (Applause.) But he\u2019s not stopping there. As a member of the National Foster Care Youth and Alumni Policy Council, he plans to use his law degree to make sure kids like him don\u2019t fall through the cracks. And it won\u2019t matter whether they\u2019re black kids or brown kids or white kids or Native American kids, because he\u2019ll understand what they\u2019re going through. And he\u2019ll be fighting for them. He\u2019ll be in their corner. That\u2019s leadership. That\u2019s a Morehouse Man right there. (Applause.)\n\nThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve come to expect from you, Morehouse \u2014 a legacy of leaders \u2014 not just in our black community, but for the entire American community. To recognize the burdens you carry with you, but to resist the temptation to use them as excuses. To transform the way we think about manhood, and set higher standards for ourselves and for others. To be successful, but also to understand that each of us has responsibilities not just to ourselves, but to one another and to future generations. Men who refuse to be afraid. Men who refuse to be afraid.\n\nMembers of the Class of 2013, you are heirs to a great legacy. You have within you that same courage and that same strength, the same resolve as the men who came before you. That\u2019s what being a Morehouse Man is all about. That\u2019s what being an American is all about.\n\nSuccess may not come quickly or easily. But if you strive to do what\u2019s right, if you work harder and dream bigger, if you set an example in your own lives and do your part to help meet the challenges of our time, then I\u2019m confident that, together, we will continue the never-ending task of perfecting our union.\n\nCongratulations, Class of 2013. God bless you. God bless Morehouse. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)3Embed"
