The Mayor\nSays this is linked to an increase in poverty\nWith the highest rates of violence taking place\nIn som\u0435 of the poorest boroughs\"\n\n[Verse]\nLook, I bet th\u0435m boys think I'm panickin'\nCheck what my young Gs are carryin'\nHis blade same length as a javelin\nI don't know about B-ball or what's happenin'\nBut know that it's fucked if he's travellin' and we see him\nI can't lie, I was depressed at phases\nI was nineteen when the team nearly left him faceless\nHopin' that we never left no traces\nYou know when you're so damn tired in your house\nBut you can't sleep cah you got pendin' cases\nI used to love temptin' fate, but now it's temptin' faces\nFor half my career, I was part of that\nMy best friend got a burner, and it's lookin' like a artifact\nPut it in your puffer or your Prada hat\nLike fuck panic, that's a heart attack\nYeah, it's like, life's so fucked in the time that we're in\nWe're fightin' the world, and we're fightin' within\nSomali dad ran away from a war\nNow his son's in a war, that's the cycle we're in\nI know niggas that didn't do time in a bin\nThat have never had freedom of mind, are you sick?\n'Round here, main way to provide for your kin\nIs in a flick blade, little push-bike and a sim\nIn London, a place where it's nicer to live\nIs only five minutes out from the guys on the strip\nWhere man make yay' work, heard he a soldier\nI know that nigga hasn't got balls like Grey Worm\nAs I grow older, change of perspective\nI gotta stay loyal to my girl, that's the trait she was blessed with\nRestaurants, raves with my bredrins\nLife's too short, so we gotta turn up\nMan talk on my ting for the 'Gram, it's intrusive\nI never really thought 'bout taking a life\nTill I found out my ex-girl's dad is abusive\nI felt, \"How could I be a man and not do shit?\"\nI'm on the way there now, and I don't wanna lose it\nBut fightin' her battle's only hurtin' the girl\nHow can I protect her from the world\nWhen I couldn't even protect her from myself?\nOn my grandmother's grave, shit happens again\nI put a knife through a family friend\nMost the women that I know had shit happen to them\nSo innocent till guilty, ain't somethin' that I have to respect\nI think back to my youth, and I was so ungrateful\nHow many of our parents had dreams they abandoned\nSo they could put food on the table?\nIntelligent, worthy, and able, that's somebody's parent\nYou know?\nAnd that affected the way that I see shit\nNightclub toilet, you peed on the seat\n'Cause you don't know how it feels when your mum's gotta clean shit\nAnd her boss treats her like she don't even mean shit\nAnd she gotta wait for the bus in the rain, and it's freezin'\nAnd Miss said that you won't ever be shit\nAnd you don't wanna cry about dad, but you need him\nI grew up so fucked, but I didn't even deep it\nI'm numb to the feelin' of grievin'\nAnd man gettin' birded\nAfrican mums on the floor, just screamin'\nIt's mad cah I try so hard\nDeath's got to be easy, cah life's so hard\nI was twelve wishin' that I was a white man, hard\nCah if I was then they probably wouldn't life man's dargs\nI was dead broke, fam, I couldn't swipe mans card\nAnd time might pass, but I still gotta stay with it\nIt wasn't his beef, but I see him try claimin' it\nThat's why he caught a bullet with another man's name on it\nNow he can't do leg day or put strain on it\nEvery time you hear me freestyle, I put pain in it\nI used to wonder, \"Does God have favourites?\"\nTouch me, it's dangerous, I wouldn't play with it\n'Cause you can go sleep, and have a different type of wake for it\nI miss my dawgs\nUnstable, you violate Chris? Then rah\nTurn Chris Benoit\nHave him hit from far, nah\nFill 'em up with bricks and glass, nah\nMy young Gs will grip, then blast\nHave you tried in the street\nFuck findin' my feet\nI could ride, but it's better when I'm ridin' a beat\nMy emotions are peak, it ain't a sign of defeat or the weak\nI would **** you, then cried in my sleep\nDropped Juss two racks and told him, \"Buy the machine\"\nI'm LeBron in Miami, I provide for the heat\nGod strike me if I'm lyin', I ain't cryin' in this beef\nUnless the tear's comin' tatted on the side of my cheek\nI provide for my peeps, the Lamb' white in the seats\nSo I'm literally a wolf disguised in a sheep\nYou have five-figure dreams, I have five-figure sleep\nFive hours more than enough time that I need\nMan want a fair fight, but I ain't on it when we see him\nFuck honour, this revolver is onomatopoeic\nLet it stut-tut-tut-tut-tut-tut-tutter when you see him\nFree Scalez, Free C and free my niggas till I see 'em\nI wouldn't wanna be 'em\nMy OG's roamin', I don't need a colosseum\nYou see it?\nSo I'm playin' it good, let hood politics stay in the hood\nFuck the internet, you see this new generation\nThey're Insta'-beefin' and I ain't into speakin'\nWhen I ducked down\nI had him runnin' in a lift like he missed a meetin'\nThere's no good reason to risk your freedom\nThe yutes dem snitch and them bitches sneakin'\nShe don't wanna talk 'bout friendship\nShe just wanna deal with the pipe like I'm fixin' leakin'\nAnd sleep with a legend like Chrissy Teigen\nWhere I'm from, the word \"Life\" has a different meanin'\nMan smile in your face, but them niggas schemin'\nTry involve me in a flakey dealin'\nSistine Chapel, I'ma paint the ceilin'\nI been violated and I hate the feelin'\nThat's why nowadays, man hates the preachin'\nWe smile in the visit, cah we ain't defeated\nThe Supreme Court's where my mates appealin'\nI can't breed that girl, that's torture\nSouth London, it's just slags on the corner\nAnd influencers tryna bag them a baller\nShe a gold digger, I can tell from her aura\nHer socials say princess, she a pauper\nWhen it's time for it, need more for my daughter\nCall me a talker, but man are gettin' lined like lambs in the slaughter\nIt's life-threatenin' and I can tell from the borer\nCut through a nigga like a knife through flora\nFeds got the guys on a case and they stalk us\nIt's a conspiracy, like tinfoil hats and a new world order\nTouch me, you better have a life insurer\nBloodthirsty, I got sharks in the water\nAnd trust me, I know a killer well, no orca\nHave you ever seen a nightmare brought to life?\nWhere I'm from, you get cheffed on a normal night\nMan talk on my name, but it's porky pies\nI'll really put it in a prick like a porcupine\nLittle bro wanna save for a .45\nGo board a flight, there's more to life\nYutes on the M6 all the time\nWe don't need TFL for a northern line\nAll the best politicians been taught to lie\nWhere do they buy cocaine when they're snortin' white?\nAre their dealers safe or on the borderline?\nIt's ironic, cah we don't know where to draw the line\nMan see Blue Story, they're mortified\nMan see Scarface and it's glorified\n'Cause when you're Black, everything gets scrutinised\nThat's why they call it \"Urban\", it gets euphemised\nSouth London, man are gettin' euthanised\nI see a yute's demise, I wasn't too surprised\nHe got soaked, but his right hand scuba dived\nDon't die by a sword that you used to shine\nYou can drown for your king, you don't know about Ophelia\nCah we got iron, I don't know about anaemia\nI took the hard road, we don't know about the easier\nOne bag of whores and drug paraphernalia\nWhen ends got sticky, had a flicky with Emelia, I mean Olivia\nThis ain't Libya, this ain't Syria\nYou act sillier, we let it seep in your skin like Nivea\nWho wants to be a millionaire? I won it\nNever done a gameshow or trivia\nI done Wandsworth, Erlestoke visitor\nI done Springhill, Grendon, Swinfen, Whitemoor, Swaleside, Brixton visitor\nI done M-way trips, done shit that I wish I never did\nBecah I could have been a prisoner\nIs this the shit that appeals to the listeners?\nRoad ain't no amazin' life\nThe ends full of snakes and jail's just a waste of time\nI tell my young Gs, \"Take your time\"\nFuck Jazz, you could really see a major nine\nYo, I'm so ashamed of how I used to get figures\nMan sell you a dream like the road ting's lit\nAnd then they leave out the parts where you're buryin' your niggas\nOr in jail, wonderin' who's puttin' dick inside your Misses\nI'm so fuckin' determined\nI was in intensive care when I was born, mummy fell down the stairs\nWhether I was gonna live or not was somethin' uncertain\nI used the word \"Fell,\" with the commas inverted\nYou see, growin' up I had it far from perfect\nBut nobody did, so I'm a normal person\nI gotta be grateful, we all have demons, and all see angels\nOr maybe it's me\nA Black yute's more than a face on a screen\nA number on a laptop or name on a sheet\nWe got stories to tell and got places to be\nFrom my heart, that's the makin' of me\nYou might also like[Outro: Juliet Doris Omoregie]\nI was selling, look, I was selling tomatoes\nI sell, my leg hurts\nI struggled 'cause I didn't want to suffer again\n**** I just wanted, he'd just make me so upset\nThree times I tried to come here\nI went to Hannover, they sent me back\nI tried so much, he has not seen anything yet\nI was in detention camps for months and years, I didn't give up\nI was not even twenty when I left Africa\nI was determined to survive\nI was determined to succeed\nI didn't know anybody, nobody was ready to help me\nEven when you were born\nYou were six weeks old, this one is not even Africa, it's this nation\nI was on the streets for three years\nI have three babies in my hand\nNobody let me in, nobody in this nation\nI couldn't pay my rent, deported gangsters carried\u2014\nI didn't give up, I carried my babies everywhere\nAnd now this is how **** pay me back for all those pain that I go through\nEvery day I lay in my bed, I'm in pain\nYou see what he's doing to me\n**** want to kill **** want to kill me17Embed"
