Lyrics[Intro]\nOne, one, one\nTwo, two, two, two\nTwo, two\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou can find me where the city meets the skyline\nKnocking back the whiskey like it's white wine\nSays she's finished work and so I bide time\nUntil I take her guard off and put it down beside mine\nIt's fine, we watch the world go by\nSaw the whole world through my girl's own eyes\nAnd they were pale like the photo size\n'Cause everybody talks the truth, no she knows those guys, but who?really, nothing of concern, see the city's on fire\nWatch the bridges as they burn\nI disappear now I'm wishing she'd return\nAt the same time, wishing I could learn\nAll this paper that I earned\nThe first bird gets the worm\nThe second mouse gets the cheese, trust\nAnd I been sat down doing this with ease\nToo much, PS, someone take it for me please, please\n\n[Chorus]\nCan't get up\nSpine won't let up\nLump in my neck\nAin't got time for a check up\nI'm fed up\nBut what am I to do?\nI'm worried 'bout you\nMy mind won't let up\nLump in my neck\nAin't got time for a check up\nI'm fed up\nBut what am I to do\nIf I'm worried 'bout you?\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nI didn't write a second verse\nSo I'll kick a free\nI'm all about being me\nLC ripping mics in the place to be\nEzra Collective, we do this frequently\nIt's me on the flipping mic\nYeah, I said it right\nI say it twice if I do this like every night\nShouts to Jorja\nMet on the stage, grab a water\nNow I talk to missus 'bout her daughter\nYeah, I oughta switch up the flow a bit\nLet me see if I can come a bit more legit\nIn a boat, no joke\nI don't smoke\nGive a toke, I don't do that\nComing with some new raps, so who's that?\nLC on the bigger mic\nI might have said that twice\nBut anyways, let me get away and come back\nKickin' real raps\nYeah, have that\n\n[Chorus]\nLet up\nWon't let up\nLump in my neck\nAin't got time for a check up\nI'm fed up, ah\nBut what am I to do?\nI'm worried 'bout you\nMy mind won't let up\nLump in my neck\nAin't got time for a check up\nI'm fed up\nBut what am I to do\nIf I'm worried 'bout you?\n[Verse 3]\nYo, I wrote another 15 or 16\nI never worry, keep my **** clean\nI seen drugs ruin lives of the pristine\nFrom the brown, all the way down to the stiff green\nThe streets are mean but my mother ain't\nAnd every late night, yeah, my mum would wait\nAnd when I staggered home, drunk in a dumberstate\nSay it straight, she'd fix me a plate, stuff it in my face\nI'd never run around the bits with the bangers really\nBut still the bangers in the bits either fan or fear me\n'Cause if I talk about my feelings and them man are near me\nChuck in some raps then a dapps, they can see it clearly\n'Cause it's inside of them\nI grab the paper and I ride the pen\nLivin' this life, I ain't tryna end\nSo I can kick it for a foe, never mind a friend\nWaiting for feelings like can rhyme again\n\n[Chorus]\nAh, can't get up\nMind won't let up\nLump in my neck\nAin't got time for a check up\nI'm fed up\nBut what am I to do?\nI'm worried 'bout you\nMy mind won't let up\nLump in my neck\nAin't got time for a check up\nI'm fed up\nBut what am I to do?\nI'm worried 'bout you\nI can't get up\nWon't let up\nIn my neck\nAin't got time for a check up\nAnd yeah, I'm fed up, yo\nBut what am I to do\nIf I been worried 'bout you?\nI been saying that my mind won't let up\nSpine won't get up\nLump in my neck\nAin't got time for a check up\nI'm fed up\nBut what am I to do\nIf I been worried 'bout you?\n[Outro]\nYou, you, you\nIf I been worried 'bout you\nI sing it now\nOne, one, one\nTwo, two, twoEmbed"
