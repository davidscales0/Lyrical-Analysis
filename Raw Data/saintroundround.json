(why?)\nCah you think he's thug? (oh yeah?)\nCheck out my flex, man I shine\nBut I still look rough because I came out the mud\nStil-Still made sure that my team had love\nI was in church tryna get blessed up\nWhen your man left town tryna sell gyal love\nI was OT just tryna get paid\nWhen your man stayed home tryna get some love\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nRound and round\nThem man were just going around\nI-I was tryna bring us up\nBare man was tryna take us down\nWe stay out the crowd\nCouldn't really care 'bout town\nWe were all uptown, tryna make up pounds\nI been about, now they loving my sound\nRound and round\nThem man were just going around\nI-I was tryna bring us up\nBare man was tryna take us down\nWe stay out the crowd\nCouldn't really care 'bout town\nWe were all uptown, tryna make up pounds\nI been about, now they loving my sound\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou think I was finished?\nHad to make bread out of town overseas\nHow could you think that I'd stay home chilling?\nGotta kill games on something like villain\nBr-Bro wanna say that my flex come dead\nWhen I saw mans check, man, I thought I'd bill him\nShown man a check of the date, just watch\nWhen the price came cropped, man I knew that hit him\n[Chorus]\nRound and round\nThem man were just going around\nI-I was tryna bring us up\nBare man was tryna take us down\nWe stay out the crowd\nCouldn't really care 'bout town\nWe were all uptown, tryna make up pounds\nI been about, now they loving my sound\n\n[Outro]\nRound and round\nThem man were just going around\nI-I was tryna bring us up\nBare man was tryna take us down\nWe stay out the crowd\nCouldn't really care 'bout town\nWe were all uptown, tryna make up pounds\nI been about, now they loving my sound1Embed"
