The rules of paradise are never nice\nThe best laid plans of Mice and Men are never right\nI'm just a Vagabond with Flowers for Algernon\nAn Average Joe who knows what the fuck is going on\nIt's the hope of my thoughts that I travel upon\nFly like an arrow of God until I'm gone, so I'm\n\n[Chorus: Cise Starr]\nDrifting away like a feather in air\nLetting my words take me away from the hurt and despair\nSo I'm keeping it vertical forever elevator\nRiding the escalator to reach something that is greater, so I'm\nDrifting away like a feather in air\nLetting my soul take me away from the hurt and despair\nSo I'm keeping it vertical forever elevator\nRiding the escalator to reach something that is greater\n\n[Verse 2: Akin Yai]\nTaking chances, word tap dancing with wolves\nIn an ice arena out there, deep in the woods of\nArizona, the sun be high, life's ironic, ain't it?\nTrying to be Dal\u00ed when I write\nSurreal Life, I paint it\nVivid, habitat crazy insane\nWatchin' propaganda six o'clock news and it\u2019s saying\nCultures clash, poor black folk and white trash\nThey revel in the cyberspace that might crash, dash\nTo millennium a million miles of running\nAt the speed of now back, don't return gunning\nRambo style, gung-ho child gunning\nAmmo blao two times, loud stunning\nStunning, when I hit ya, lift you off the Earth like\nAyo, take you right back to birth and\nNiggas wonder why, they might wonder why\nThis shit might happen but it does, they go\nYou might also like[Chorus: Cise Starr]\nDrifting away like a feather in air\nLetting my words take me away from the hurt and despair\nSo I'm keeping it vertical forever elevator\nRiding the escalator to reach something that is greater, so I'm\nDrifting away like a feather in air\nLetting my soul take me away from the hurt and despair\nSo I'm keeping it vertical forever elevator\nRiding the escalator to reach something that is greater\n\n[Verse 3: Cise Starr]\nTreat you better than me 'cause that's the heavenly key\nTo unlock the inner strength where my essence will be\nIt's the knowledge and self-understanding of the things around me\nThat becomes the wisdom that I need\nLiving this life to the best of my ability\nChanneling energy to my thoughts, attain symmetry\nRemember me, because my prose remain gold\nI got the gift of gab like them pimps in Kangol\nIt never ends, I keep it rolling like a cypher\nThe first caveman bringing fire\nInnovating and higher; to plasma states I raise the stakes\nIt's double or nothing in this vacuum space\nI will, survive, divine the time to cry\nFuck a hold or hide, I'm alive with pride\nAnd I drove the Chevy to the Levy\nBut the Levy was dry, singing \"This will be the day that I die\"71Embed"
