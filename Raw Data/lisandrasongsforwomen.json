Before that we lived on Loomis on the third floor and before that we lived on Keeler. Before Keeler it was Paulina, and before that I can't remember. But what I remember most is moving a lot. Each time it seemed there'd be one more of us. By the time we got to Mango Street we were six--Mama, Papa, Carlos, Kiki, my sister Nenny and me.\nThe house on Mango Street is ours, and we don't have to pay rent to anybody, or share the yard with the people down stairs, or be careful not to make too much noise, and there isn't a landlord banging on the ceiling with a broom. But even so, it's not the house we'd thought we'd get.\nWe had to leave the flat on Loomis quick. The water pipes broke and the landlord wouldn't fix them because the house was too old. We had to leave fast. We were using the washroom next door and carrying water over in empty milk gallons. That's why Mama and Papa looked for a house, and that's why we moved into the house on Mango Street, far away, on the other side of town.\nThey always told us that one day we would move into a house, a real that would be ours for always so we wouldn't have to move each year. And our house would have running water and pipes that worked. And inside it would have real stairs, not hallway stairs, but stairs inside like the house on T.V.And we'd have a basement and at least three washrooms so when we took a bath we wouldn't have to tell everybody. Our house would be white with trees around it, a great big yard and grass growing without a fence. This was the house Papa talked about when he held a lottery ticket and this was the house mama dreamed up in the stories she told us before we went to bed.\nBut the house on Mango street is not the way they told it at all. It's small and red with tight steps in front and windows so small you'd think they were holding their breath. Bricks are crumbling in places, and the front door is so swollen you have to push hard to get in. There is no front yard, only four little elms the city planted by the curb. Out back is a small garage for the car we don't own yet and a small yard that looks smaller between the two buildings on either side. There are stairs, and the house has only one washroom. Everybody has to share a bedroom--Mama and Papa, Carlos and Kiki, me and Nenny.\nOnce when we were living on Loomis, a nun from my school passed by and saw m playing out front. The laundromat downstairs had been boarded up because it had been robbed two days before and the owner has painted on the wood YES WE'RE OPEN so as not to lose business.\n\nWhere do you live? she asked.\nThere, I said pointing up to the third floor\nYou live there?\n\nThere. I had to look to where she pointed--the third floor, the painting peeling, wooden bars Papa had nailed on the windows so we wouldn't fall out. You live there? The way she said it made me feel like nothing. There. I loved there. I nodded.\nI knew then I had to have a house. A real house. One I could point to. But this isn't it. The house on Mango Street isn't it. For the time being, Mama says. Temporary, says Papa. But I know how those things go.\n\nHairs.\n\nEverybody in our family has different hair. My Papa's hair is like a broom, all up in the air. And me, my hair is lazy. It never obeys barrettes or bands. Carlos' hair is thick and straight. He doesn't need to comb it. Nenny's hair is slippery\u2014\u2014slides out of your hand. And Kiki, who is the youngest, has hair like fur.\nBut my mother's hair, my mother's hair, like little rosettes, like little candy circles all curly and pretty because she pinned it in pincurls all day, sweet to put your nose into when she is holding you, holding you and you feel safe, is the warm smell of bread before you bake it, is the smell when she makes room for you on her side of the bed still warm with her skin, and you sleep near her, the rain outside falling and Papa snoring. The snoring, the rain, and Mama's hair that smells like bread.\n\nBoys & Girls\n\nThe boys and the girls live in separate worlds. The\nboys in their universe and we in ours. My brothers for\nexample. They've got plenty to say to me and Nenny inside\nthe house. But outside they can't be seen talking to girls.\nCarlos and Kiki are each other's best friend ... not ours.\nNenny is too young to be my friend. She's just my\nsister and that was not my fault. You don't pick your sisters,\nyou just get them and sometimes they come like Nenny.\nShe can't play with those Vargas kids or she'll turn\nout just like them. And since she comes right after me, she\nis my responsibility.\nSomeday I will have a best friend all my own. One I\ncan tell my secrets to. One who will understand my jokes\nwithout my having to explain them. Until then I am a red\nballoon, a balloon tied to an anchor.\n\nMy Name\n\nIn English my name means hope. In Spanish it means\ntoo many letters. It means sadness, it means waiting. It is\nlike the number nine. A muddy color. It is the Mexican\nrecords my father plays on Sunday mornings when he is\nshaving, songs like sobbing.\nIt was my great-grandmother's name and now it is\nmine. She was a horse woman too, born like me in the\nChinese year of the horse-which is supposed to be bad\nluck if you're born female-but I think this is a Chinese\nlie because the Chinese, like the Mexicans, don't like their\nwomen strong.\nMy great-grandmother. I would've liked to have known her, a wild horse of a woman, so wild she wouldn't\nmarry. Until my great-grandfather threw a sack over her\nhead and carried her off. Just like that, as if she were a\nfancy chandelier. That's the way he did it.\nAnd the story goes she never forgave him. She looked I\nout the window her whole life, the way so many women sit\ntheir sadness on an elbow. I wonder if she made the best\nwith what she got or was she sorry because she couldn't be\nall the things she wanted to be. Esperanza. I have inherited\nher name, but I don't want to inherit her place by the\nwindow.\nAt school they say my name funny as if the syllables\nwere made out of tin and hurt the roof of your mouth.\nBut in Spanish my name is made out of a softer something,\nlike silver, not quite as thick as sister's name Magdalena-which is uglier than mine. Magdalena who at\nleast can come home and become Nenny. But I am always\nEsperanza.\nI would like to baptize myself under a new name, a\nname more like the real me, the one nobody sees. Esperanza\nas Lisandra or Maritza or Zeze the X. Yes. Something\nlike Zeze the X will do.\n\nCathy Queen of Cats\nShe says, I am the great great grand cousin of the\nqueen of France. She lives upstairs, over there, next door\nto Joe the baby-grabber. Keep away from him, she says.\nHe is full of danger. Benny and Blanca own the comer\nstore. They're okay except don't lean on the candy counter.\nTwo girls raggedy as rats live across the street. You don't\nwant to know them. Edna is the lady who owns the building\nnext to you. She used to own a building big as a whale, but\nher brother sold it. Their mother said no, no, don't ever\nsell it. I won't. And then she closed her eyes and he sold\nit. Alicia is stuck-up ever since she went to college. She used\nto like me but now she doesn't.\nCathy who is queen of cats has cats and cats and cats.\nBaby cats, big cats, skinny cats, sick cats. Cats asleep like\nlittle donuts. Cats on top of the refrigerator. Cats taking a\nwalk on the dinner table. Her house is like cat heaven.\nYou want a friend, she says. Okay, I'll be your friend.\nBut only till next Tuesday. That's when we move away.\nGot to. Then as if she forgot I just moved in, she says the\nneighborhood is getting bad.\nCathy'S father will have to fly to France one day and\nfind her great great distant grand cousin on her father's\nside and inherit the family house. How do I know this is\nso? She told me so. In the meantime they'll just have to\nmove a little farther north from Mango Street, a little farther\naway every time people like us keep moving in.\nOur Good Day\n\nIf you give me five dollars I will be your friend forever.\nThat's what the little one tells me.\nFive dollars is cheap since I don't have any friends\nexcept Cathy who is only my friend till Tuesday.\nFive dollars, five dollars.\nShe is trying to get somebody to chip in so they can\nbuy a bicycle from this kid named Tito. They already have\nten dollars and all they need is five more.\nOnly five dollars, she says.\nDon', talk to them, says Cathy. Can't you see they smell\nlike a broom.\nBut I like them. Their clothes are crooked and old. They are wearing shiny Sunday shoes without socks. It\nmakes their bald ankles all red, but I like them. Especially\nthe big one who laughs with all her teeth. I like her even\nthough she lets the little one do all the talking.\nFive dollars, the little one says, only five. !\nCathy is tugging my arm and I know whatever I do\nnext will make her mad forever.\nWait a minute, I say, and run inside to get the five\ndollars. I have three dollars saved and I take two of Nenny's.\nShe's not home, but I'm sure she'll he glad when she\nfinds out we own a bike. When I get back, Cathy is gone\nlike I knew she would be, but I don't care. I have two new\nfriends and a bike too.\nMy name is Lucy, the big one says. This here is Rachel\nmy sister.\nI'm her sister, says Rachel. Who are you?\nAnd I wish my name was Cassandra or Alexis or Maritza-anything\nbut Esperanza-but when I tell them my\nname they don't laugh.\nWe come from Texas, Lucy says and grins. Her was\nborn here, but me I'm Texas.\nYou mean she, I say.\nNo, 1'1)1 from Texas, and doesn't get it.\nThis bike is three ways ours, says Rachel who is thinking\nahead already. Mine today, Lucy's tomorrow and yours\nday after.\nBut everybody wants to ride it today because the bike\nis new, so we decide to take turns after tomorrow. Today\nit belongs to all of us.\nI don't tell them about Nenny just yet. It's too complicated.\nEspecially since Rachel almost put out Lucy's eye\nabout who was going to get to ride it first. But finally we\nagree to ride it together. Why not?\nBecause Lucy has long legs; she pedals. I sit on the back seat and Rachel is skinny enough to get up on the\nhandlebars which makes the bike all wobbly as if the wheels\nare spaghetti, hut after a bit you get used to it.\nWe ride fast and faster. Past my house, sad and red\nand crumbly in places, past Mr. Benny's grocery on the\ncorner, and down the avenue which is dangerous. Laundromat, junkstore, drugstore, windows and cars and more\ncars, and around the block back to Mango.\nPeople on the bus wave. A very fat lady crossing the\nstreet says, You sure got quite a load there.\nRachel shouts, You got quite a load there too. She is\nvery sassy.\nDown, down Mango Street we go. Rachel, Lucy, me.\nOur new bicycle. Laughing the crooked ride back.\n\nLaughter\nNenny and I don't look like sisters ... not right away.\nNot the way you can tell with Rachel and Lucy who have\nthe same fat popside lips like everybody else in their family.\nBut me and Nenny, we are more alike than you would\nknow. Our laughter for example. Not the shy ice cream\nbells' giggle of Rachel and Lucy's family, but all ofa sudden\nand surprised like a pile of dishes breaking. And other\nthings I can't explain.\nOne day we were passing a house that looked, in my\nmind, like houses I had seen in Mexico. I don't know why.\nThere was nothing about the house that looked exactly like the homes I remembered. I'm not even sure why I thought it but it seemed to feel right.\nLook. at that house, I said, it looks like Mexico.\nRachel and Lucy look at me like I'm crazy, but before\nLucy can let out a laugh, Nenny says: Yes, that's Mexico all\nright. That's what I was thinking exactly.\n\nGil's Furniture Bought & Sold\n\nThere is a junk store. An old man owns it. We bought\na used refrigerator from him once, and Carlos sold a box\nof magazines for a dollar. The store is small with just a\ndirty window for light. He doesn't turn the lights on unless\nyou got money to buy things with, so in the dark we look\nand see all kinds of things, me and Nenny. Tables with\ntheir feet upside-down and rows and rows of refrigerators\nwith round corners and couches that spin dust in the air\nwhen you punch them and a hundred T.V.'s that don't\nwork probably. Everything is on top of everything so the\nwhole store has skinny aisles to walk through. You can get\nlost easy.\nThe owner, he is a black man who doesn't talk much\nand sometimes if you didn't know better you could be in there a long time before your eyes notice a pair of gold glasses floating in the dark. Nenny who thinks she is smart and talks to any old man, asks lots of questions. Me, I never\nsaid nothing to him except once when I bought the Statue\nof liberty for a dime.\nBut Nenny, I hear her asking one time how's this here\nand the man says, This, this is a music box, and I turn\naround quick thinking he means a pretty box with flowers\npainted on it, with a ballerina inside. Only there's nothing\nlike that where this old man is pointing, just a wood box\nthat's old and got a big brass record in it with holes. Then\nhe starts it up and all sorts of things start happening. It's\nlike all of a sudden he let go a million moths all over the\ndusty furniture and swan-neck shadows and in our bones.\nIt's like drops of water. Or like marimbas only with a funny\nlittle plucked sound to it like if you were running your\nfingers across the teeth of a metal comb.\nAnd then I don't know why, but I have to turn around\nand pretend I don't care about the box so Nenny won't see\nhow stupid I am. But Nenny, who is stupider, already is\nasking how much and I can see her fingers going for the\nquarters in her pants pocket.\n\nThis, the old man says shutting the lid, this ain't for\nsale.\n\nMeme Ortiz\n\nMeme Ortiz moved into Cathy's house after her family\nmoved away. His name isn't really Meme. His name isJuan.\nBut when we asked him what his name was he said Meme,\nand that's what everybody calls him except his mother.\nMeme has a dog with gray eyes, a sheepdog with two\nnames, one in English and one in Spanish. The dog is big,\nlike a man dressed in a dog suit, and runs the same way\nits owner does, clumsy and wild and with the limbs flopping\nallover the place like untied shoes.\n\nCathy's father built the house Meme moved into. It\nis wooden. Inside the floors slant. Some rooms uphill. Some\ndown. And there are no closets. Out front there are twenty one steps, all lopsided and jutting like crooked teeth (made\nthat way on purpose, Cathy said, so the rain will slide off),\nand when Meme's mama calls from the doorway, Meme goes scrambling up the twenty-one wooden stairs with the\ndog with two names scrambling after him.\n\nAround the back is a yard, mostly dirt, and a greasy\nbunch of boards that used to be a garage. But what you\nremember most is this tree, huge, with fat arms and mighty\nfamilies of squirrels in the higher branches. All around,\nme neighborhood of roofs, black-tarred and A-framed,\nand in their gutters, the balls that never came back down\nto earth. Down at the base of the tree, the dog with two\nnames barks into the empty air, and there at the end of\nthe block, looking smaller still, our house with its feet\ntucked under like a cat.\nThis is the tree we chose for the First Annual Tarzan\nJumping Contest. Meme won. And broke both arms.\n\nLouie, His Cousin & His Other Cousin\n\nDownstairs from Meme's is a basement apartment that\nMeme's mother fixed up and rented to a Puerto Rican\nfamily. Louie's family. Louie is the oldest in a family of\nlittle sisters. He is my brother's friend really, but I know\nhe has two cousins and that his T-shirts never stay tucked\nin his pants.\nLouie's girl cousin is older than us. She lives with\nLouie's family because her own family is in Puerto Rico.\nHer name is Marin or Maris or something like that, and\nshe wears dark nylons all the time and lots of makeup she\ngets free from selling Avon. She can't come out-gotta\nbaby-sit with Louie's sisters-but she stands in the doorway a lot, all the time singing, clicking her fingers, the same song:\n\nApples, peaches, pumpkin pah-ay.\nYou're in love and so am ah-ay.\n\nLouie has another cousin. We only saw him once, but\nit was important. We were playing volleyball in the alley\nwhen he drove up in this great big yellow Cadillac with\nwhitewalls and a yellow scarf tied around the mirror.\nLouie's cousin had his arm out the window. He honked a\ncouple of times and a lot of faces looked out from Louie's\nback window and then a lot of people came out-Louie,\nMarin and all the little sisters.\nEverybody looked inside the car and asked where he\ngot it. There were white rugs and white leather seats. We\nall asked for a ride and asked where he got it. Louie's cousin\nsaid get in.\nWe each had to sit with one of Louie's little sisters on\nour lap, but that was okay. The seats were big and soft like\na sofa, and there was a little white cat in the back window\nwhose eyes lit up when the car stopped or turned. The\nwindows didn't roll up like in ordinary cars. Instead there\nwas a button that did it for you automatically. We rode up\nthe alley and around the block six times, but Louie's cousin\nsaid he was going to make us walk home if we didn't stop\nplaying with the windows or touching the FM radio.\nThe seventh time we drove into the alley we heard\nsirens ... real quiet at first, but then louder. Louie's cousin\nstopped the car right where we were and said, Everybody\nout of the car. Then he took off flooring that car into a\nyellow blur. We hardly had time to think when the cop car\npulled in the alley going just as fast. We saw the yellow\nCadillac at the end of the block trying to make a left-hand\nturn, but our alley is too skinny and the car hashed into\na lamppost.\nMarin screamed and we ran down the block to where\nthe cop car's siren spun a dizzy blue. The nose of that yellow\nCadillac was all pleated like an alligator's, and except for\na bloody lip and a bruised forehead, Louie's cousin was\nokay. They put handcuffs on him and put him in the backseat\nof the cop car, and we all waved as they drove away.\n\nMarin\n\nMarin's boyfriend is in Puerto Rico. She shows us his\nletters and makes us promise not to tell anybody they're\ngetting married when she goes back to P.R. She says he\ndidn't get a job yet, but she's saving the money she gets\nfrom selling Avon and taking care of her cousins.\nMarin says that if she stays here next year, she's going\nto get a real job downtown because that's where the best\njobs are, since you always get to look beautiful and get to\nwear nice clothes and can meet someone in the subway who\nmight marry you and take you to live in a big house far\naway.\nBut next year Louie's parents are going to send her back to her mother with a letter saying she's too much\ntrouble, and that is too bad because I like Marin. She is\nolder and knows lots of things. She is the one who told us\nhow Davey the Baby's sister got pregnant and what cream\nis best for taking off moustache hair and if you count the\nwhite flecks on your fingernails you can know how many\nboys are thinking of you and lots of other things I can't\nremember now.\nWe never see Marin until her aunt comes home from -.\nwork, and even then she can only stay out in front. She is\nthere every night with the radio. When the light in her\naunt's room goes out, Marin lights a cigarette and it doesn't\nmatter if it's cold out or if the radio doesn't work or if we've\ngot nothing to say to each other. What matters, Marin says,\nis for the boys to see us and for us to see them. And since\nMarin's skirts are shorter and since her eyes are pretty,\nand since Marin is already older than us in many ways, the\nboys who do pass by say stupid things like I am in love with\nthose two green apples you call eyes, give them to me why\ndon't you. And Marin just looks at them without even blinking and is not afraid.\nMarin, under the streetlight, dancing by herself, is\nsinging the same song somewhere. I know. Is waiting for\na car to stop, a star to fall, someone to change her life.\n\nThose Who Don't\n\nThose who don't know any better come into our neighborhood\nscared. They think we're dangerous. They think\nwe will attack them with shiny knives. They are stupid\npeople who are lost and got here by mistake.\nBut we aren't afraid. We know the guy with the crooked\neye is Davey the BabY's brother, and the tall one next to\nhim in the straw brim, that's Rosa's Eddie V., and the big\none that looks like a dumb grown man, he's Fat Boy, though\nhe's not fat anymore nor a boy.\nAll brown all around, we are safe. But watch us drive\ninto a neighborhood of another color and our knees go\nshakity-shake and our car windows get rolled up tight and\nour eyes look straight. Yeah. That is how it goes and goes.\n\nThere was an Old Woman She Had So Many Children She Didn't Know What to Do\n\nRosa Vargas' kids are too many and too much. It's\nnot her fault you know, except she is their mother and\nonly one against so many.\nThey are bad those Vargases, and how can they help\nit with only one mother who is tired all the time from\nbuttoning and bottling and babying, and who cries every\nday for the man who left without even leaving a dollar for bologna or a note explaining how come.\nThe kids bend trees and bounce between cars and\ndangle upside down from knees and almost break like\nfancy museum vases you can't replace. They think it's\nfunny. They are without respect for all things living, including themselves.\nBut after a while you get tired of being worried about\nkids who aren't even yours. One day they are playing\nchicken on Mr. Benny's roof. Mr. Benny says, Hey ain't\nyou kids know better than to he swinging up there? Come\ndown, you come down right now, and then they just spit.\nSee. That's what I mean. No wonder everybody gave\nup. Just stopped looking out when little Efren chipped his\nbuck tooth on a parking meter and didn't even stop Refugia\nfrom getting her head stuck between two slats in the back\ngate and nobody looked up not once the day Angel Vargas\nlearned to fly and dropped from the sky like a sugar donut,\njust like a faIling star, and exploded down to earth without\neven an \"Oh.\"\n\nAlicia Who Sees Mice\n\nClose your eyes and they'll go away, her father says,\nor You're just imagining. And anyway, a woman's place is\nsleeping so she can wake up early with the tortilla star, the\none that appears early just in time to rise and catch the\nhind legs hide behind the sink, beneath the four-clawed\ntub, under the swollen floorboards nobody fixes, in the\ncorner of your eyes.\nAlicia, whose mama died, is sorry there is no one older\nto rise and make the lunchbox tortillas. Alicia, who inherited\nher mama's rolling pin and sleepiness, is young and\nsmart and studies for the first time at the university. Two\ntrains and a bus, because she doesn't want to spend her whole life in a factory or behind a rolling pin. Is a good\ngirl, my friend, studies all night and sees the mice, the ones\nher father says do not exist. Is afraid of nothing except\nfour-legged fur. And fathers.\n\nDarius & The Clouds\n\nYou can never have too much sky. You can fall asleep\nand wake up drunk on sky, and sky can keep you safe when\nyou are sad. Here there is too much sadness and not\nenough sky. Butterflies too are few and so are flowers and\nmost things that are beautiful. Still, we take what we can\nget and make the best of it.\nDarius, who doesn't like school, who is sometimes stupid\nand mostly a fool, said something wise today, though\nmost days he says nothing. Darius, who chases girls with\nfirecrackers or a stick that touched a rat and thinks he's\ntough, today pointed up because the world was full of\nclouds, the kind like pillows.\nYou all see that cloud, that fat one there? Darius said,\nthat? Where? That one next to the one that look like\npopcorn. That one there. See that. That's God, Darius said.\nGod? somebody little asked. God, he said, and made it\nsimple.\n\nAnd Some More\n\nThe Eskimos got thirty different names for snow, I\nsay. I read it in a book.\nI got a cousin, Rachel says. She got three different\nnames.\nThere ain't thirty different kinds of snow, Lucy says.\nThere are two kinds. The clean kind and the dirty kind,\nclean and dirty. Only two.\nThere are a million zillion kinds, says Nenny. No two\nexactly alike. Only how do you remember which one is\nwhich?\nShe got three last names and, let me see, two first\nnames. One in English and one in Spanish ...\nAnd clouds got at least ten different names, I say.\nNames for clouds? Nenny asks. Names just like you and me?\nThat up there, that's cumulus, and everybody looks\nup.\nCumulus are cute, Rachel says. She would say something\nlike that.\nWhat's that one there? Nenny asks, pointing a finger.\nThat's cumulus too. They're all cumulus today. Cumulus,\ncumulus, cumulus.\nNo, she says. That there is Nancy, otherwise known\nas Pig-eye. And over there her cousin Mildred, and little\nJoey, Marco, Nereida and Sue.\nThere are all different kinds of clouds. How many\ndifferent kinds of clouds can you think of?\nWell, there's these already that look like shaving\ncream ...\nAnd what about the kind that looks like you combed\nits hair? Yes, those are clouds too.\nPhyllis, Ted, Alfredo and Julie ...\nThere are clouds that look like big fields of sheep,\nRachel says. Them are my favorite.\nAnd don't forget nimbus the rain cloud, I add, that's\nsomething.\nJose and Dagoberto, Alicia, Raul, Edna, Alma and\nRickey ...\nThere's that wide puffy cloud that looks like your face\nwhen you wake up after falling asleep with all your clothes\non.\nReynaldo, Angelo, Albert, Armando, Mario ...\nNot my face. Looks like your fat face.\nRita, Margie, Ernie ...\nWhose fat face?\nEsperanza's fat face, that's who. Looks like Esperan\u00adza's ugly face when she comes to school in the morning.\nAnita, Stella, Dennis, and Lolo ...\nWho you calling ugly, ugly?\nRichie, Yolanda, Hector, Stevie, Vincent ...\nNot you. Your mama, that's who.\nMy mama? You better not be saying that, Lucy Guerrero.\nYou better not be talking like that ... else you can\nsay goodbye to being my friend forever.\nI'm saying your mama's ugly like ... ummm ...\n... like bare feet in September!\nThat does it! Both of yous better get out of my yard\nbefore I call my brothers.\nOh, we're only playing.\nI can think of thirty Eskimo words for you, Rachel.\nThirty words that say what you are.\nOh yeah, well I can think of some more.\nUh-oh, Nenny. Better get the broom. Too much trash\nin our yard today.\nFrankie, Licha, Maria, Pee Wee ...\nNenny, you better tell your sister she is really crazy\nbecause Lucy and me are never coming back here again.\nForever.\n\nReggie, Elizabeth, Lisa, Louie ...\nYou can do what you want to do, Nenny, but you\nbetter not talk to Lucy or Rachel if you want to be my sister.\nYou know what you are, Esperanza? You are like the\nCream of Wheat cereal. You're like the lumps.\nYeah, and you're foot fleas, that's you.\nChicken lips.\nRosemary, Dalia, Lily ...\nCockroach jelly.\nJean, Geranium and Joe ...\nCold frijoles\nMimi, Michael, Moe ...\nYour mama's frijoles.\nYour ugly mama's toes.\nThat's stupid.\nBebe, Blanca, Benny ...\nWho's stupid?\nRachel, Lucy, Esperanza, and Nenny.\n\n\n\nThe Family of Little Feet\n\nThere was a family. All were little. Their arms were\nlittle, and their hands were little, and their height was not\ntall, and their feet very small.\nThe grandpa slept on the living room couch and\nsnored through his teeth. His feet were fat and doughy\nlike thick tamales, and these he powdered and stuffed into white socks and brown leather shoes.\nThe grandma's feet were lovely as pink pearls and\ndressed in velvety high heels that made her walk with a\nwobble, but she wore them anyway because they were\npretty.\nThe baby's feet had ten tiny toes, pale and see-through like a salamander's. and these he popped into his mouth\nwhenever he was hungry.\nThe mother's feet, plump and polite. descended like\nI white pigeons from the sea of pillow, across the linoleum\nroses, down down the wooden stairs, over the chalk hopscotch\nsquares, 5,6, 7, blue sky.\nDo you want this? And gave us a paper bag with one\npair of lemon shoes and one red and one pair of dancing shoes that used to be white but were now pale blue.\nHere, and we said thank you and waited until she went\nupstairs. Hurray! Today we are Cinderella because our feet fit\nexactly, and we laugh\n\n\n\n\n\nA Rice Sandwich\n\nThe special kids, the ones who wear keys around their\nnecks, get to eat in the canteen. The canteen! Even the\nname sounds important. And these kids at lunch time go\nthere because their mothers aren't home or horne is too\nfar away to get to.\nMy home isn't far but it's not close either, and somehow\nI got it in my head one day to ask my mother to make\nme a sandwich and write a note to the principal so I could\neat in the canteen too.\nOh no, she says pointing the butter knife at me as if\nI'm starting trouble, no sir. Next thing you k.now everybody\nwill be wanting a bag lunch-I'll be up all night cuttingbRad into little triangles, this one with mayonnaise, this\none with mustard, no pickles on mine, but mustard on one\nside please. You kids just like to invent more work for me.\nBut Nenny says she doesn't want to eat at schoolever-because\nshe likes to go horne with her best friend\nGloria who lives across the schoolyard. Gloria's mama has\nit big color T.V. and all they do is watch cartoons. Kiki and\nCarlos, on the other hand, are patrol boys. They don't want\nto eat at school either. They like to stand out in the cold\nespecially if it's raining. They think suffering is good for\nyou ever since they saw that movie 300 Spartans.\nI'm no Spartan and hold up an anemic wrist to prove\nit. I can't even blow up a balloon without getting dizzy.\nAnd besides, I know how to make my own lunch. If I ate\nat school there'd be less dishes to wash. You would see me\nless and less and like me better. Everyday at noon my chair\nwould be empty. Where is my favorite daughter you would\ncry, and when I came home finally at three p.m. you would\nappreciate me.\nOkay, okay, my mother says after three days of this.\nAnd the following morning I get to go to school with my\nmother's letter and a rice sandwich because we don't have lunch meat.  Mondays or Fridays, it doesn't matter, mornings always\ngo by slow and this day especially. But lunchtime\ncame finally and I got to get in line with the stay-at-school\nkids. Everything is fine until the nun who knows all the\ncanteen kids by heart looks at me and says: You, who sent\nyou here? And since I am shy, I don't say anything, just\nhold out my hand with the letter. This is no good, she says,\ntill Sister Superior gives the okay. Go upstairs and see her.\nAnd so I went.\nI had to wait for two kids in front of me to get hollered\nat, one because he did something in class, the other because he didn't. My turn came and I stood in front of the big\ndesk with holy pictures under the glass while the Sister\nSuperior read my letter. It went like this:\n\nDear Sister Superior,\nPlease let Esperanza eat in the lunchroom\nbecause she lives too far away and she gets tired.\nAs you can see she is very skinny. I hope to God\nshe does not faint.\nThanking you,\nMrs. E. Cordero\n\nYou don't live far, she says. You live across the boulevard.\nThat's only four blocks. Not even. Three maybe.\nThree long blocks away from here. I bet I can see your\nhouse from my window. Which one? Come here. Which\none is your house?\nAnd then she made me stand up on a box of books\nand point. That one? she said, pointing to a row of ugly\nthree-flats, the ones even the raggedy men are ashamed to\ngo into. Yes, I nodded even though I knew that wasn't my\nhouse and started to cry. I always cry when nuns yell at\nme, even if they're not yelling.\nThen she was sorry and said I could stay-just for\ntoday, not tomorrow or the day after-you go home. And\nI said yes and could I please have a Kleenex-I had to\nblow my nose.\nIn the canteen, which was nothing special, lots of boys\nand girls watched while I cried and ate my sandwich, the\nbread already greasy and the rice cold.\n\nChanclas\n\nIt's me-Mama, Mama said. I open up and she's there\nwith bags and bi~ boxes, the new clothes and, yes, she's got\nthe socks and a new slip with a little rose on it and a pink and-white\nstriped dress. What about the shoes? I forgot.\nToo late now. I'm tired. Whew!\nSix-thirty already and my little cousin's baptism is\nover. All day waiting, the door locked, don't open up for\nnobody, and I don't till Mama gets back and buys everything\nexcept the shoes.\nNow Uncle Nacho is coming in his car, and we have\nto hurry to get to Precious Blood Church quick because\nthat's where the baptism party is, in the basement rented for today for dancing and tamales and everyone's kids running\nall over the place. Mama dances, laughs, dances. All of a sudden, Mama is sick. I fan her hot face with a paper plate. Too many tamales, but uncle Nacho says too many this and tilts his thumb to his lips.\nEverybody laughing except me, because I'm wearing\nthe new dress, pink and white with stripes, and new underclothes\nand new socks and the old saddle shoes I wear\nto school, brown and white, the kind I get every September\nbecause they last long and they do. My feet scuffed and\nround, and the heels all crooked that look dumb with this\ndress, so I just sit.\nMeanwhile that boy who is my cousin by first communion\nor something asks me to dance and I can't. Just\nstuff my feet under the metal folding chair stamped Precious\nBlood and pick on a wad of brown gum that's stuck\nbeneath the seat. I shake my head no. My feet growing\nbigger and bigger.\nThen Uncle Nacho is pulling and pulling my arm and\nit doesn't matter how new the dress Mama bought is because\nmy feet are ugly until my uncle who is a liar says,\nYou are the prettiest girl here, will you dance, but I believe\nhim, and yes, we are dancing, my Uncle Nacho and me,\nonly I don't want to at first. My feet swell big and heavy\nlike plungers, but I drag them across the linoleum Roor\nstraight center where Uncle wants to show off the new\ndance we learned. And Uncle spins me, and my skinny\narms bend the way he taught me, and my mother watches,\nand my little cousins watch, and the boy who is my cousin\nby first communion watches, and everyone says, wow, who\nare those two who dance like in the movies, until I forget\nthat I am wearing only ordinary shoes, brown and white,\nthe kind my mother buys each year for school.\nAnd all I hear is the clapping when the music stops.\nMy uncle and me bow and he walks me back in my thick\nshoes to my mother who is proud to be my mother. All\nnight the boy who is a man watches me dance. He watched\nme dance.\n\nHips\nI like coffee, I like tea.\n\nIlike the boys and the boys like me.\n\nYes, no, maybe so. Yes, no, maybe so ...\n\nOne day you wake up and they are there. Ready and\nwaiting like a new Buick with the keys in the ignition. Ready\nto take you where?\nThey're good for holding a baby when you're cooking,\nRachel says, turning the jump rope a little quicker. She has\nno imagination.\nYou need them to dance, says Lucy..\n\nIf you don't get them you may turn into a man. Nenny believes this and she believes it. She is this way because of her\nage.\nThat's right, I add before Lucy or Rachel can make\nfun of her. She is stupid alright, but she is my sister.\nBut most important, hips are scientific, I say repeating\nwhat Alicia already told me. It's the bones that let you know\nwhich skeleton was a man's when it was a man and which\na woman's.\nThey bloom like roses, I continue because it's obvious\nI'm the only one who can speak with any authority; I have\nscience on my side. The bones just one day open. Just like\nthat. One day you might decide to have kids, and then\nwhere are you going to put them? Got to have room. Bones\ngot to give.\nBut don't have too many or your behind will spread.\nThat's how it is, says Rachel whose mama is as wide as a\nboat. And we just laugh. What I'm saying is who here is ready? You gotta be\nable to know what to do with hips when you get them, I\nsay making it up as I go. You gotta know how to walk with\nhips, practice you know-like if half of you wanted to go\none way and the other half the other.\nThat's to lullaby it, Nenny says, that's to rock the baby\nasleep inside you. And then she begins singing seashells,\ncopper bells, eroy, ivy, over.\nI'm about to tell her that's the dumbest thing I've ever\nheard, but the more I think about it ...\nYou gotta get the rhythm, and Lucy begins to dance.\nShe has the idea, though she's having trouble keeping her\nend of the double-dutch steady.\nIt's gotta be just so, I say. Not too fast and not too\nslow. Not too fast and not too slow.\nWe slow the double circles down to a certain speed so\nRachel who has just jumped in can practice shaking it.\nI want to shake like hoochi-coochie, Lucy says. She is\ncrazy.\nI want to move like heebie-jeebie, I say picking up on\nthe cue.\nI want to be Tahiti. Or merengue. Or electricity.\nOr tembleque!\nYes, tembleque. That's a good one.\nAnd then it's Rachel who starts it:\nSkip, sJcip,\n\nsnake in your hips.\n\nWiggle around\n\nand break your lip.\n\nLucy waits a minute before her turn. She is thinking.\nThen she begins:\nThe waitress with the big fat hips\n\nwho pays the rent with taxi tips . . .\n\nsays nobody in town will kiss her on the lips\n\nbecause . ..\n\nbecause she looks like Christopher Columbus!\n\nYes, no, maybe so. Yes, no, maybe so.\n\nShe misses on maybe so. I take a little while before\n\nmy turn, take a breath, and dive in:\n\nSome are skinny like chuken lips.\n\nSome are baggy like soggy Band-Aids\n\nafter you get out of the bathtub.\n\nI don't care what kind I get.\n\nJust as long as I get hips.\n\nEverybody getting into it now except Nenny who is\n\nstill humming not a girl, not a boy, just a little baby. She's like\n\nthat.\n\nWhen the two arcs open wide like jaws Nenny jumps in across from me, the rope tick-ticking, the little gold\nearrings our mama gave her for her First Holy Communion\nbouncing. She is the color of a bar of naphtha laundry\nsoap, she is like the little brown piece left at the end of the\nwash, the hard little bone, my sister. Her mouth opens.\nShe begins:\n\nMy mother and your mother were washing clothes.\nMy mother punched your mother right in the nese.\nWhat color blood came out1\nNot that old song, I say. You gotta use your own song.\nMake it up, you know? But she doesn't get it or won't. It's\nhard to say which. The rope turning, turning, turning.\nEngine, engine number nine,\nrunning down Chicago line.\nIf the train runs off the track\ndo you want your money back\nDo you want your MONEY back\nYes, no, maybe so. Yes, no, maybe so ...\n\nI can tell Lucy and Rachel are disgusted, but they\ndon't say anything because she's my sister.\nYes, no, maybe so. Yes, no, maybe so . ..\nNenny, I say, but she doesn't hear me. She is too many\nlight-years away. She is in a world we don't belong to anymore.\nNenny. Going. Going.\nY-E-S spells yes and out you go!\n\n\n\nThe First Job -- Will\n\nIt wasn't as if I didn't want to work. I did. I had even\ngone to the social security office the month before to get\nmy social security number. I needed money. The Catholic\nhigh school cost a lot, and Papa said nobody went to public\nschool unless you wanted to turn out bad.\nI thought I'd find an easy job, the kind other kids\nhad, working in the dime store or maybe a hotdog stand.\nAnd though I hadn't started looking yet, I thought I might\nthe week after next. But when I came home that afternoon,\nall wet because Tito had pushed me into the open water\nhydrant-only I had sort of let him-Mama called me in\nthe kitchen before I could even go and change, and AuntLa1a _~ sitting there drinking her coffee with a spoon.\nAunt Lala said she had found a job for me at the Peter\nPan Photo Finishers on North Broadway where she\nworked, and how old was I, and to show up tomorrow\nsaying I was one year older, and that was that.\nSo the next morning I put on the navy blue dress that\nmade me look older and borrowed money for lunch and\nbus fare because Aunt Lala said I wouldn't get paid till the\nnext Friday, and I went in and saw the boss of the Peter\nPan Photo Finishers on North Broadway where Aunt Lala\nworked and lied about my age like she told me to and sure\nenough, I started that same day.\nIn my job I had to wear white gloves. I was supposed\nto match negatives with their prints, just look at the picture\nand look for the same one on the negative strip, put it in\nthe envelope, and do the next one. That's all. I didn't know\nwhere these envelopes were coming from or where they\nwere going. I just did what I was told.\nIt was real easy, and I guess I wouldn't have minded\nit except that you got tired after a while and I didn't know\nif I could sit down or not, and then I started sitting down\nonly when the two ladies next to me did. After a while they\nstarted to laugh and came up to me and said I could sit\nwhen I wanted to, and I said I knew.\nWhen lunchtime came, I was scared to eat alone in\nthe company lunchroom with all those men and ladies looking,\nso I ate real fast standing in one of the washroom stalls\nand had lots of time left over, so I went back to work early.\nBut then break time came, and not knowing where else to\ngo, I went into the coatroom because there was a bench\nthere.\nI guess it was the time for the night shift or middle\nshift to arrive because a few people came in and punched\nthe time clock, and an older Oriental man said hello andwe talked for a while about my just starting, and he said\nwe could be friends and next time to go in the lunchroom\nand sit with him, and I felt better. He had nice eyes and 1\ndidn't feel so nervous anymore. Then he asked if 1 knew\nwhat day it was, and when I said 1 didn't, he said it was his\nbirthday and would I please give him a birthday kiss. 1\nthought I would because he was so old and just as I was\nabout to put my lips on his cheek, he grabs my face with\nboth hands and kisses me hard on the mouth and doesn't\nlet go.\n\n\nPapa Who Wakes Up Tired In The Dark\n\nYour abuelito is dead, Papa says early one morning\nin my room. Esta muerto, and then as if he just heard the\nnews himself, crumples like a coat and cries, my brave Papa\ncries. I have never seen my Papa cry and don't know what\nto do.\nI know he will have to go away, that he will take a\nplane to Mexico, all the uncles and aunts will be there, and\nthey will have a black-and-white photo taken in front of\nthe tomb with flowers shaped like spears in a white vase\nbecause this is how they send the dead away in that country.\nBecause I am the oldest, my father has told me first,\nand now it is my turn to tell the others. I will have to explain why we can't play. I will have to tell them to be quiet today.\nMy Papa. his thick hands and thick shoes, who wakes\nup tired in the dark, who combs his hair with water, drinks\nhis coffee, and is gone before we wake, today is sitting on\nmy bed.\nAnd I think if my own Papa died what would I do. I\nhold my Papa in my arms. I hold and hold and hold him.\n\n\n\nBorn Bad\n\nMost likely I will go to hell and most likely I deserve\nto be there. My mother says I was born on an evil day and\nprays for me. Lucy and Rachel pray too. For ourselves and\nfor each other ... because of what we did to Aunt Lupe.\nHer name was Guadalupe and she was pretty like my\nmother. Dark. Good to look at. In her Joan Crawford dress\nand swimmer's legs. Aunt Lupe of the photographs.\nBut I knew her sick from the disease that would not\ngo, her legs bunched under the yellow sheets, the bones\ngone limp as worms. The yellow pillow, the yellow smell,\nthe bottles and spoons. Her head thrown back like a thirsty\nlady. My aunt, the swimmer.\nHard to imagine her legs once strong, the bones hard\nand parting water, clean sharp strokes, not bent and wrinkled like a baby, not drowning under the sticky yellow light.\nSecond-floor rear apartment. The naked light bulb. The\nhigh ceilings. The light bulb always burning.\nI don't know who decides who deserves to go bad. I\nThere was no evil in her birth. No wicked curse. One day - I believe she was swimming, and the next day she was sick.\nIt might have been the day that gray photograph was taken.\nIt might have been the day she was holding cousin Totchy\nand baby Frank. It might have been the moment she\npointed to the camera for the kids to look and they\nwouldn't.\nMaybe the sky didn't look the day she fell down.\nMaybe God was busy. It could be true she didn't dive right\none day and hurt her spine. Or maybe the story that she\nfell very hard from a high step stool, like Totchy said, is\ntrue.\nBut I think diseases have no eyes. They pick with a\ndizzy finger anyone, just anyone. Like my aunt who happened\nto be walking down the street one day in her Joan ,\nCrawford dress, in her funny felt hat with the black feather,\ncousin Totchy in one hand, baby Frank in the other.\nSometimes you get used to the sick and sometimes\nthe sickness, if it is there too long, gets to seem normal.\nTh'is is how it was with her, and maybe this is why we chose\nher.\nIt was a game, that's all. It was the game we played\nevery afternoon ever since that day one of us invented it-\ncan't remember who-I think it was me.\nYou had to pick somebody. You had to think of someone\neverybody knew. Someone you could imitate and\neveryone else would have to guess who it was. It started\nout with famous people: Wonder Woman, the Beatles,\nMarilyn Monroe.... But then somebody thought it'd be better if we changed the game a little. if we pretended we were Mr. Benny, or his wife Blanca, or Ruthie, or anybody we knew.\nI don't know why we picked her. Maybe we were bored\nthat day. Maybe we got tired. We liked my aunt. She listened\nto our stories. She always asked us to come back.\nLucy, me, Rachel. I hated to go there alone. The six blocks\nto the dark apartment, second-floor rear building where\nsunlight never came, and what did it matter? My aunt was\nblind by then. She never saw the dirty dishes in the sink.\nShe couldn't see the ceilings dusty with flies, the ugly maroon walls, the bottles and sticky spoons. I can't forget the smell. Like sticky capsules filled with jelly. My aunt, a little oyster, a little piece of meat on an open shell for us to look at. Hello, hello. As if she had fallen into a well.\nI took my library books to her house. I read her stories.\nI liked the book The Waterbabies. She liked it too. I\nnever knew how sick she was until that day I tried to show\nher one of the pictures in the book, a beautiful color picture\nof the water babies swimming in the sea. I held the book\nup to her face. I can't see it, she said, I'm blind. And then\nI was ashamed.\nShe listened to every book, every poem I read her.\nOne day I read her one of my own. I came very dose. I\nwhispered it into the pillow:\nI want to be\nlike the waves on the sea,\nlike the douds in the wind,\nbut I'm me.\nOne day I'll jump\nout of my skin.\nI'll shake the sky\nlike a hundred violins.\nThat's nice. That's very good, she said in her tired voice.\nYou just remember to keep writing, [speranza. You must\nkeep writing. It will keep you free, and I said yes, but at\nthat time I didn't know what she meant.\nThe day we played the game, we didn't know she was\ngoing to die. We pretended with our heads thrown back,\nour arms limp and useless, dangling like the dead. We\nlaughed the way she did. We talked the way she talked, the\nway blind people talk without moving their head. We imitated\nthe way you had to lift her head a little so she could\ndrink water, she sucked it up slow out of a green tin cup.\nThe water was warm and tasted like metal. Lucy laughed.\nRachel too. We took turns being her. We screamed in the\nweak voice of a parrot for Totchy to come and wash those\ndishes. It was easy.\nWe didn't know. She had been dying such a long time,\nwe forgot. Maybe she was ashamed. Maybe she was embarrassed\nit took so many years. The kids who wanted to\nbe kids instead of washing dishes and ironing their papa's\nshirts, and the husband who wanted a wife again.\nAnd then she died, my aunt who listened to my poems.\nAnd then we began to dream the dreams.\n\nElenita, Cards, Palm, Water\n\nElenita, witch woman, wipes the table with a rag because\nErnie who is feeding the baby spilled Kool-Aid. She\nsays: Take that crazy baby out of here and drink your KoolAid\nill the living room. Can't you see I'm busy? Ernie takes\nthe baby into the living room where Bugs Bunny is on T.V.\nGood lucky you didn't come yesterday, she says. The\nplanets were all mixed up yesterday.\nHer T.V. is color and hig and all her pretty furniture\nmade out of red fur like the teddy bears they give away in\ncarnivals. She has them covered with plastic. I think this is\non account of the baby.\nYes, it's a good thing, I say.\nBut we stay in the kitchen because this is where she\nworks. The top of the refrigerator busy with holy candles,\nsome lit, some not, red and green and blue, a plaster saint\nand a dusty Palm Sunday cross, and a picture of the voodoo\nhand taped to the wall.\nGet the water, she says.\nI go to the sink and pick the only clean glass there, a\nbeer mug that says the beer that made Milwaukee famous,\nand fill it up with hot water from the tap, then put the\nglass of water on the center of the table, the way she taught\nme.\nLook in it; do you see anything?\nBut all I see are bubbles.\nYou see anybody's face?\nNope, just bubbles, I say.\nThat's okay, and she makes the sign of the cross over\nthe water three times and then begins to cut the cards.\nThey're not like ordinary playing cards, these cards.\nThey're strange, with blond men on horses and crazy baseball\nbats with thorns. Golden goblets, sad-looking women\ndressed in old-fashioned dresses, and roses that cry..\nThere is a good Bugs Bunny cartoon on T.V.) know,\nI saw it before and recognize the music and wish) could\ngo sit on the plastic couch with Ernie and the baby, but\nnow my fortune begins. My whole life on that kitchen table:\npast, present, future. Then she takes my hand and looks\ninto my palm. Closes it. Closes her eyes too.\nDo you feel it, feel the cold?\nYes, I lie, but only a little.\nGood, she says, Los esperitus are here. And begins.\nThis card, the one with the dark man on a dark horse,\nthis means jealousy, and this one, sorrow. Here a pillar of\nbees and this a mattress of luxury. You will go to a wedding soon and did you lose an anchor of arms, yes, an anchor\nof arms? It's clear that's what that means.\nWhat about a house, I say, because that's what I came\nfor.\nAh, yes, a home in the heart. I see a home in the\nheart.\nIs that it?\nThat's what I see, she says, then gets up because the\nkids are fighting. Elenita gets up to hit and then hug them.\nShe really does love them, only sometimes they are rude.\nShe comes back and can tell I'm disappointed. She's\na witch woman and knows many things. If you got a headache,\nrub a cold egg across your face. Need to forget an\nold romance? Take a chicken's foot, tie it with red string,\nspin it over your head three times, then burn it. Bad spirits\nkeeping you awake? Sleep next to a holy candle for seven\ndays, then on the eighth day, spit. And lots of other stuff.\nOnly now she can tell I'm sad.\nBaby, I'll look again if you want me to. And she looks\nagain into the cards, palm, water, and says uh-huh.\nA home in the heart, I was right.\nOnly I don't get it.\nA new house, a house made of heart. I'll light a candle\nfor you.\nAll this for five dollars I give her.\nThank you and goodbye and be careful of the evil\neye. Come back again on a Thursday when the stars are\nstronger. And may the Virgin bless you. And shuts the\ndoor.\n\nGeraldo No Last Name\n\nShe met him at a dance. Pretty too, and young. Said\nhe worked in a restaurant, but she can't remember which\none. Geraldo. That's all. Green pants and Saturday shirt.\nGeraldo. That's what he told her.\nAnd how was she to know she'd be the last one to see\nhim alive. An accident, don't you know. Hit-and-run. Marin,\nshe goes to all those dances. Uptown. Logan. Embassy.\nPalmer. Aragon. Fontana. The Manor. She likes to dance.\nShe knows how to do cumbias and salsas and rancheras\neven. And he was just someone she danced with. Somebody\nshe met that night. That's right.\nThat's the story. That's what she said again and again.\n<>ott to the hospital people and twice to the police. No\naddress. No name. Nothing in his pockets. Ain't it a shame.\nOnly Marin can't explain why it mattered, the hours\nand hours, for somebody she didn't even know. The hospital\nemergency room. Nobody but an intern working all\nalone. And maybe if the surgeon would've come, maybe if\nhe hadn't lost so much blood, if the surgeon had only come,\nthey would know who to notify and where.\nBut what difference does it make? He wasn't anything\nto her. He wasn't her boyfriend or anything like that. Just\nanother brazer who didn't speak English. Just another wetback.\nYou know the kind. The ones who always look\nashamed. And what was she doing out at three a.m. anyway?\nMarin who was sent home with her coat and some\naspirin. How does she explain?\nShe met him at a dance. Geraldo in his shiny shirt and\ngreen pants. Geraldo going to a dance.\nWhat does it matter?\nThey never saw the kitchenettes. They never knew\nabout the two-room flats and sleeping rooms he rented,\nthe weekly money orders sent home, the currency exchange.\nHow could they?\nHis name was Geraldo. And his home is in another\ncountry. The ones he left behind are far away, will wonder,\nshrug. remember. Geraldo...he went north... we never\nheard from him again.\n\n\nEdna\u2019s Ruthie\n\n\nRuthie, tall skinny lady with red lipstick and blue babushka,\none blue sock and one green because she forgot,\nis the only grown-up we know who likes to play. She takes\nher dog Bobo for a walk and laughs all by herself, that\nRuthie. She doesn't need anybody to laugh with, she just laughs.\nShe is Edna's daughter, the lady who owns the big\nbuilding next door, three apartments front and back. Every\nweek Edna is screaming at somebody, and every week\nsomebody has to move away. Once she threw out a pregnant\nlady just because she owned a duck ... and it was a nice duck too. But Ruthie lives here and Edna can't throw\nher out because Ruthie is her dauRhter.\nRuthie came one day, it seemed, out of nowhere.\nAnReI Vargas was trying to teach us how to whistle. Then\nI we heard someone whistling-beautiful like the Emperor's\nnightingale-and when we turned around there was\nRuthie.\nSometimes we go shopping and take her with us, but\nshe never comes inside the stores and if she does she keeps\nlooking around her like a wild animal in a house for the\nfirst time.\nShe likes candy. When we go to Mr. Benny's grocery\nshe gives us money to buy her some. She says make sure\nit's the soft kind because her teeth hurt. Then she promises\nto see the dentist next week, but when next week comes,\nshe doesn't go.\nRuthie sees lovely things everywhere. I might be telling\nher ajoke and she'll stop and say: The moon is beautiful\nlike a balloon. Or somebody might be singing and she'll point to a few clouds: Look, Marlon Brando. Or a sphinx\nwinking. Or my left shoe.\nOnce some friends of Edna's came to visit and asked\nRuthie if she wanted to go with them to play bingo. The\ncar motor was running, and Ruthie stood on the steps\nwondering whether to go. Should I go, Ma? she asked the\ngray shadow behind the second-Roor screen. I don't care,\nsays the screen, go if you want. Ruthie looked at the ground. What do you think, Ma? Do what you want, how\nshould I know? Ruthie looked at the ground some more.\nThe car with the motor running waited fifteen minutes\nand then they left. When we brought out the deck of cards\nthat night, we let Ruthie deal.\nThere were many things Ruthie could have been if\nshe wanted to. Not only is she a good whistler, but she can\nsing and dance too. She had lots of job offers when she\nwas young, but she never took them. She got married in\u00adstead and moved away to a pretty house outside the city.\nOnly thing I can't understand is why Ruthie is living on\nMango Street if she doesn't have to, why is she sleeping on!\na couch in her mother's living room when she has a real\nhouse all her own, but she says she's just visiting and next weekend her husband's going to take her home. But the weekends come and go and Ruthie stays. No matter. We are glad because she is our friend.\nI like showing Ruthie the books I take out of the library. Books are wonderful, Ruthie says, and then she\nruns her hand over them as if she could read them in\nbraille, They're wonderful, wonderful, but I can't read anymore.\nI get headaches. I need to go to the eye doctor next\nweek. I used to write children's books once, did I tell you?\nOne day I memorized all of \"The Walrus and the\nCarpenter\" because I wanted Ruthie to hear me. \"The sun\nwas shining on the sea, shining with all his might ...\"\nRuthie looked at the sky and her eyes got watery at times.\nFinally I came to the last lines: \"But answer came there\nnone-and this was scarcely odd, because they'd eaten\neveryone ...\" She took a long time looking at me before\nshe opened her mouth, and then she said, You have the\nmost beautiful teeth I have ever seen, and went inside.\n\nThe Earl of Tennessee\n\nEarl lives next door in Edna's basement, behind the\nflower boxes Edna paints green each year, behind the dusty\ngeraniums. We used to sit on the flower boxes until the day\nTito saw a cockroach with a spot of green paint on its head.\nNow we sit on the steps that swing around the basement\napartment where Earl lives.\nEarl works nights. His blinds are always closed during\nthe day. Sometimes he comes out and tells us to keep quiet.\nThe little wooden door that has wedged shut the dark for\nso long opens with a sigh and lets out a breath of mold\nand dampness, like books that have been left out in the\nrain. This is the only time we see Earl except for when he\ncomes and goes to work. He has two little black dogs that\ngo everywhere with him. They don't walk. like ordinary\ndogs, but leap and somersault like an apostrophe and\ncomma. f At night Nenny and I can hear when Earl comes home ,\nfrom work. First the click and whine of the car door open\u00ad f\ning, then the scrape of concrete, the excited tinkling of dog\ntags, followed by the heavy jingling of keys, and finally the\nmoan of the wooden door as it opens and lets loose its sigh\nof dampness.\nEarl is a jukebox repairman. He learned his trade in\nthe South, he says. He speaks with a Southern accent,\nsmokes fat cigars and wears a felt hat-winter or summer,\nhot or cold, don't matter-a felt hat. In his apartment are\nboxes and boxes of 45 records, moldy and damp like the\nsmell that comes out of his apartment whenever he opens\nthe door. He gives the records away to us-all except the\ncountry and western.\nThe word is that Earl is married and has a wife somewhere.\nEdna says she saw her once when Earl brought her\nto the apartment. Mama says she is a skinny thing, blond\nand pale like salamanders that have never seen the sun.\nBut I saw her once too and she's not that way at all. And\nthe boys across the street say she is a tall red-headed lady\nwho wears tight pink pants and green glasses. We never\nagree on what she looks like, but we do know this. Whenever\nshe arrives, he holds her tight by the crook of the\narm. They walk fast into the apartment, lock the door\nbehind them and never stay long.\n\nSire\n\nI don't remember when I first noticed him looking at\nme-Sire. But I knew he was looking. Every time. All the\ntime I walked past his house. Him and his friends sitting\non their bikes in front of the house, pitching pennies. They\ndidn't scare me. They did, but I wouldn't let them know.\nI don't croSS the street like other girls. Straight ahead,\nstraight eyes. I walked past. I knew he was looking. I had\nto prove to me I wasn't scared of nobody's eyes, not even\nhis. I had to look back hard, just once, like he was glass.\nAnd I did. I did once. But I looked too long when he rode\nhis bike past me. I looked because I wanted to be brave,\nstraight into the dusty cat fur of his eyes and the bike\nstopped and he bumped into a parked car, bumped, and\nI walked fast. It made your blood freeze to have somebody\nlook at you like that. Somebody looked at me. Somebody\nlooked. But his kind, his ways. He is a punk, Papa says,\nand Mama says not to talk to him.\nAnd then his girlfriend came. Lois I heard him call\nher. She is tiny and pretty and smells like baby's skin. I see\nher sometimes running to the store for him. And once\nwhen she was standing next to me at Mr. Benny's grocery\nshe was barefoot, and I saw her barefoot baby toenails all\npainted pale pale pink, like little pink seashells, and she\nsmells pink like babies do. She's got big girl hands, and her\nbones are long like ladies' bones, and she wears makeup\ntoo. But she doesn't know how to tie her shoes. I do.\nSometimes I hear them laughing late, beer cans and\ncats and the trees talking to themselves: wait, wait, wait.\nSire lets Lois ride his bike around the block, or they take\nwalks together. I watch them. She holds his hand, and he\nstops sometimes to tie her shoes. But Mama says those kinds\nof girls, those girls are the ones that go into alleys. Lois\nwho can't tie her shoes. Where does he take her?\nEverything is holding its breath inside me. Everything\nis waiting to explode like Christmas. I want to be all new\nand shiny. I want to sit out bad at night, a boy around my\nneck and the wind under my skirt. Not this way, every\nevening talking to the trees, leaning out my window, imagining\nwhat I can't see.\nA boy held me once so hard, I swear, I felt the grip\nand weight of his arms, but it was a dream.\nSire. How did you hold her? Was it? Like this? And\nwhen you kissed her? Like this?\n\n\n\nFour Skinny Trees\n\n\nThey are the only ones who understand me. I am the\nonly one who understands them. Four skinny trees with\nskinny necks and pointy elbows like mine. Four who do\nnot belong here but are here. Four raggedy excuses planted\nby the city. From our room we can hear them, but Nenny\njust sleeps and doesn't appreciate these things.\nTheir strength is secret. They send ferocious roots\nbeneath the ground. They grow up and they grow down\nand grab the earth between their hairy toes and bite the\nsky with violent teeth and never quit their anger. This is\nhow they keep.\nLet one forget his reason for being, they'd all droop like tulips in a glass, each with their arms around the other.\nKeep, keep, keep, trees say when I sleep. They teach.\nWhen I am too sad and too skinny to keep keeping,\nwhen I am a tiny thing against so many bricks, then it is I\nlook at trees. When there is nothing left to look at on this\nstreet. Four who grew despite concrete. Four who reach I\nand do not forget to reach. Four whose only reason is to\n, be and be.\n\n\nNo Speak English\n\n\nMamacita is the big mama of the man across the street,\nthird-floor front. Rachel says her name ought to be Mamasota,\nbut I think that's mean.\nThe man saved his money to bring her here. He saved\nand saved because she was alone with the baby boy in that\ncountry. He worked two jobs. He came home late and he\nleft early. Every day.\nThen one day Mamacita and the baby boy arrived\nin a yellow taxi. The taxi door opened like a waiter's\narm. Out stepped a tiny pink shoe, a foot soft as a rabbit's\near, then the thick ankle, a Rutter of hips, fuchsia\nroses and green perfume. The man had to pull her,\nthe taxicab driver had to push. Push, pull. Push, pull.\nPoof!\nAll at once she bloomed. Huge, enormous, beautiful\nto look at, from the salmon-pink feather on the tip of her\nhat down to the little rosebuds of her toes. I couldn't take\nmy eyes off her tiny shoes.\nUp, up, up the stairs she went with the baby boy in a\nblue blanket, the man carrying her suitcases, her lavender\nhatboxes, a dozen boxes of satin high heels. Then we didn't\nsee her.\nSomebody said because she's too fat, somebody because\nof the three flights of st3irs, but I believe she doesn't\ncome out because she is afraid to speak English, and maybe\nthis is so since she only knows eight words. She knows to\nsay: He not here for when the landlord comes, No speak\nEnglish if anybody else comes, and Holy smokes. I don't know\nwhere she learned this, but I heard her say it one time and\nit surprised me.\nMy father says when he came to this country he ate\nhamandeggs for three months. Breakfast, lunch and dinner.\nHamandeggs. That was the only word he knew. He\ndoesn't eat hamandeggs anymore.\nWhatever her reasons, whether she is fat, or can't\nclimb the stairs, or is afraid of English, she won't come\ndown. She sits all day by the window and plays the Spanish\nradio show and sings all the homesick songs about her\n. country in a voice that sounds like a seagull.\nHome. Home. Home is a house in a photograph, a\npink house, pink as hollyhocks with lots of startled light.\nThe man paints the walls of the apartment pink, but it's\nnot the same, you know. She still sighs for her pint house,\nand then I think she cries. I would.\nSometimes the man gets disgusted. He starts screaming\nand you can hear it all the way down the street.\nAy. she says, she is sad.\nOh, he says. Not again.\n,Ctuindo, ctuindo, ctuindor she asks. I\nI\nf~ jAy, caray! We are home. This is home. Here I am and\nhere I stay. Speak English. Speak English. Christ!\njAy! Mamacita, who does not belong, every once in a\nwhile lets out a cry, hysterical. high, as if he had torn the\nonly skinny thread that kept her alive, the only road out\nto that country.\nAnd then to break her heart forever, the baby boy,\nwho has begun to talk. starts to sing the Pepsi commercial\nhe heard on T.V.\nNo speak English. she says to the child who is singing\nin the language that sounds like tin. No speak English, no\nspeak English, and bubbles into tears. No, no, no, as if she\ncan't believe her ears.\n\nRafaela Who Drinks Coconut & Papaya Juice on Tuesday\n\nOn Tuesdays Rafaela's husband comes home late because\nthat's the night he plays dominoes. And then Rafaela,\nwho is still young but getting old from leaning out the\nwindow SO much, gets locked indoors because her husband\nis afraid Rafaela will run away since she is too beautiful to\nlook at.\nRafaela leans out the window and leans on her elbow\nand dreams her hair is like Rapunzel's. On the corner there\nis music from the bar, and Rafaela wishes she could go\nthere and dance before she gets old.\nA long time passes and we forget she is up there\nwatching until she says: Kids, if I give you a dollar will you go to the store and buy me something? She throws a crumpled\ndonar down and always asks for coconut or sometimes\npapaya juice, and we send it up to her in a paper shopping\nbag she lets down with clothesline.\nRafaela who drinks and drinks coconut and papaya juice on Tuesdays and wishes there were sweeter drinks,\nnot bitter like an empty room, but sweet sweet like the island, like the dance hall down the street where women\nmuch older than her throw green eyes easily like dice and\nopen homes with keys. And always there is someone offering sweeter drinks. someone promising to keep them\non a silver string.\n\nSally\n\n\nSally is  the girl with eyes like Egypt and nylons the\ncolor of smoke. The boys at school think she's beautiful\nbecause her hair is shiny black like raven feathers and when she laughs, she flicks her hair back like a satin shawl over\nher shoulders and laughs.\nHer father says to be this beautiful is trouble. They\nare very strict in his religion. They are not supposed to\ndance. He remembers his sisters and is sad. Then she can't\ngo oul. Sally I mean.\nSally, who taught you to paint your eyes like Cleopatra?\nAnd if I roll the little brush with my tongue and chew it to a point and dip it in the muddy cake, the one\nin the little red box, will you teach me?\nI like your black coat and those shoes you wear, where\ndid you get them? My mother says to wear black so young\nis dangerous, but I want to buy shoes just like yours, like\nyour black ones made out of suede, just like those. And\none day, when my mother's in a good mood, maybe after\nmy next birthday, I'm going to ask to buy the nylons too.\nCheryl, who is not your friend anymore, not since last\nTuesday before Easter, not since the day you made her ear\nbleed, not since she called you that name and bit a hole in\nyour arm and you looked as if you were going to cry and\neveryone was waiting and you didn't, you didn't, Sally, not\nsince then, you don't have a best friend to lean against the\nschoolyard fence with, to laugh behind your hands at what\nthe boys say. There is no one to lend you her hairbrush.\nThe stories the boys tell in the coatroom, they're not\ntrue. You lean against the schoolyard fence alone with your\neyes closed as if no one was watching, as if no one could\nsee you standing there, Sally. What do you think about\nwhen you dose your eyes like that? And why do you always\nhave to go straight home after school? You become a different\nSally. You pull your skirt straight, you rub the blue\npaint off your eyelids. You don't laugh, Sally. You look at\nyour feet and walk fast to the house you can't come out\nfrom. Sally, do you sometimes wish you didn't have to go\nhome? Do you wish your feet would one day keep walking\nand take you far away from Mango Street, far away and\nmaybe your feet would stop in front of a house, a nice one\nwith flowers and big windows and steps for you to climb\nup two by two upstairs to where a room is waiting for you.\nAnd if you opened the little window latch and gave it a\nshove, the windows would swing open, all the sky would come in. There'd be no nosy neighbors watching, no motorcycles\nand cars, no sheets and towels and laundry. Only\ntrees and more trees and plenty of blue sky. And you could\nlaugh, Sally. You could go to sleep and wake up and never\nhave to think who likes and doesn't like you. You could\nclose your eyes and you wouldn't have to worry what people\nsaid because' you never belonged here anyway and nobody\ncould make you sad and nobody would think you're strange\nbecause you like to dream and dream. And no one could\nyell at you if they saw you out in the dark leaning against\na car, leaning against somebody without someone thinking\nyou are bad, without somebody saying it is wrong, without\nthe whole world waiting for you to make a mistake when\nall you wanted, all you wanted, Sally, was to love and to\nlove and to love and ta love, and no one could call that\ncrazy.\n\nMinerva Writes Poems\n\n\nMinerva is only a little bit older than me but already\nshe has two kids and a husband who left. Her mother raised\nher kids alone and it looks like her daughters will go that\nway too. Minerva cries because her luck is unlucky. Every\nnight and every day. And prays. But when the kids are\nasleep after she's fed them their pancake dinner, she writes\npoems on little pieces of paper that she folds over and over\nand holds in her hands a long time, little pieces of paper\nthat smell like a dime.\nShe lets me read her poems. I let her read mine. She\nis always sad like a house on fire-always something wrong.\nShe has many troubles, but the big one is her husband who r\nleft and keeps leaving.\nOne day she is through and lets him know enough is\nenough. Out the door he goes. Clothes, records, shoes. Out\nthe window and the door locked. But that night he comes\nback and sends a big rock through the window. Then he\nis sorry and she opens the door again. Same story.\nNext week she comes over black and blue and asks .\u00ad\nwhat can she do? Minerva. I don't know which way she'll II.\ngo. There is nothing I can do.\n\n\n\nBums in the Attic\n\nI want a house on a hill like the ones with the gardens\nwhere Papa works. We go on Sundays, Papa's day off. I\nused to go. I don't anymore. You don't like to go out with\nus, Papa says. Getting too old? Getting too stuck-up, says\nNenny. I don't tell them I am ashamed-all of us staring\nout the window like the hungry. I am tired of looking at\nwhat we can't have. When we win the lottery ... Mama\nbegins, and then I stop listening.\nPeople who live on hills sleep so close to the stars they\nforget those of us who live too much on earth. They don't\nlook down at all except to be content to live on hills. They have nothing to do with last week's garbage or fear of rats.\nNight comes. Nothing wakes them but the \"'-md.\nOne day I'll own my own house, but I won't forget\nwho I am or where I came from. Passing bums will ask\nCan I come in? I'll offer them the attic, ask them to stay.\nbecause I know how it is to be without a house.\nSome days after dinner, guests and I will sit in froot\nof a fire. Floorboards will squeak upstairs. The attic grumble.\nRats? they'll ask.\nBums, I'll say, and I'll be happy.\n\n\n\nBeautiful & Cruel\n\nI am an ugly daughter. I am the one nobody comes\nfor.\nNenny says she won't wait her whole life for a husband\nto come and get her, that Minerva's sister left her mother's\nhouse by having a baby, but she doesn't want to go that\nway either. She wants things all her own, to pick and choose.\nNenny has pretty eyes and it's easy to talk that way if you\nare pretty.\nMy mother says when I get older my dusty hair will\nsettle and my blouse will learn to stay clean, but I have\ndecided not to grow up tame like the others who lay their\nnecks on the threshold waiting for the ball and chain.In the movies there is always one with red red lips . who is beautiful and cruel. She is the one who drives the\nmen crazy and laughs them all away. Her power is her own.\nShe will not give it away.\nI have begun my own quiet war. Simple. Sure. I am\none who leaves the table like a man, without putting back\nthe chair or picking up the plate.\n\n\nA Smart Cookie\n\nI could've been somebody, you know? my mother says\nand sighs. She has lived in this city her whole life. She can\nspeak two languages. She can sing an opera. She knows\nhow to fix a T.V. But she doesn't know which subway train\nto take to get downtown. I hold her hand very tight while\nwe wait for the right train to arrive.\nShe used to draw when she had time. Now she draws\nwith a needle and thread, little knotted rosebuds, tulips\nmade of silk thread. Someday she would like to go to the\nballet. Someday she would like to see a play. Shf' borrows\nopera records from the public library and sings with velvety\nlungs powerful as morning glories. Today while cooking oatmeal she is Madame Butterfly\nuntil she sighs and points the wooden spoon at me. I\ncould've been somebody, you know? Esperanza, you go to\nschool. Study hard. That Madame Butterfly was a fool. She\nstirs the oatmeal. Look at my comadres. She means Izaura\nwhose husband left and Yolanda whose husband is dead.\nGot to take care all your own, she says shaking her head.\nThen out of nowhere:\nShame is a bad thing, you know. It keeps you down.\nYou want to know why I quit school? Because I didn't have\nnice clothes. No clothes, but I had brains.\nYup. she says disgusted, stirring again. I was a smart\ncookie then.\n\n\nWhat Sally Said\n\nHe never hits me hard. She said her mama rubs lard on all the places where it hurts. Then at school she'd say she fell. That's where all the blue places come from. That's why her skin is always scarred.\nBut who believes her. A girl that big, a girl who comes\nin with her pretty face all beaten and black can't be falling\noff the stairs. He never hits me hard. But Sally doesn't tell about that time he hit her with\nhis hands just like a dog, she said, like if I was an animal. J\nHe thinks I'm going to run away like his sisters who made\nthe family ashamed. Just because I'm a daughter, and then\nshe doesn't say Sally was going to get permission to stay with us a little and one Thursday she came finally with a sack full of clothes and a paper bag of sweetbread her mama sent. And would've stayed too except when the dark came her father, whose eyes were little from crying, knocked on the door and said please come back, this is the last time. And she said Daddy and went home.\nThen we didn't need to worry. Until one day Sally's\nfather catches her talking to a boy and the next day she\ndoesn't come to school. And the next. Until the way Sally\ntells it, he just went crazy, he just forgot he was her father\nbetween the buckle and the belt. You're not my daughter, you're not my daughter.\nAnd then he broke into his hands.\n\nThe Monkey Garden\n\nThe monkey doesn't live there anymore. The monkey\nmoved-to Kentucky-and took his people with him. And\nI was glad because I couldn't listen anymore to his wild\nscreaming at night, the twangy yakkety-yak of the people\nwho owned him. The green metal cage, the porcelain table\ntop, the family that spoke like guitars. Monkey, family,\ntable. All gone.\nAnd it was then we took over the garden we had been\nafraid to go into when the monkey screamed and showed\nits yellow teeth.\nThere were sunflowers big as flowers on Mars and\nthick cockscombs bleeding the deep red fringe of theater\ncurtains. There were dizzy bees and bow-tied fruit flies\nturning somersaults and humming in the air. Sweet sweet\npeach trees. Thorn roses and thistle and pears. Weeds like\nso many squinty-eyed stars and brush that made your ankles\nitch and itch until you washed with soap and water.\nThere were big green apples hard as knees. And everywhere\nthe sleepy smell of rotting wood, damp earth and\ndusty hollyhocks thick and perfumy like the blue-blond\nhair of the dead. Yellow spiders ran when we turned rocks over and\npale worms blind and afraid of light rolled over in their\nsleep. Poke a stick in the sandy soil and a few blue-skinned\nbeetles would appear, an avenue of ants, so many crusty\nlady bugs. This was a garden, a wonderful thing to look at\nin the\t spring. But bit by bit, after the monkey left, the\ngarden began to take over itself. Flowers stopped obeying\nthe little bricks that kept them from growing beyond their\npaths. Weeds mixed in. Dead cars appeared overnight like\nmushrooms. First one and then another and then a pale\nblue pickup with the front windshield missing. Before you knew it, the monkey garden became filled with sleepy cars.\n, Things had a way of disappearing in the garden, as\nif the garden itself ate them, or, as if with its old-man\nmemory, it put them away and forgot them. Nenny found\na dollar and a dead mouse between two rocks in the stone\nwall where the morning glories climbed, and once when\nwe were playing hide-and-seek, Eddie Vargas laid his head\nbeneath a hibiscus tree and fell asleep there like a Rip Van\nWinkle until somebody remembered he was in the game\nand went back to look for him.\nThis, I suppose, was the reason why we went there.\nFar away from where our mothers could find us. We and\na few old dogs who lived inside the empty cars. We made\na clubhouse once on the back of that old blue pickup. And besides. we liked to jump from the roof of one car to another\nand pretend they were giant mushrooms.\nSomebody started the lie that the monkey garden had\nbeen there before anything. We liked to think the garden\ncould hide things for a thousand years. There beneath the\nroots of soggy flowers were the bones of murdered pirates\nand dinosaurs, the eye of a unicorn turned to coal.\nThis is where I wanted to die and where I tried one\nday but not even the monkey garden would have me. It\nwas the last day I would go there.  Who was it that said I was getting too old to play the\ngames? Who was it I didn't listen to? I only remember that\nwhen the others ran, I wanted to run too, up and down\nand through the monkey garden, fast as the boys, not like\nSally who screamed if she got her stockings muddy.\nI said, Sally, come on, but she wouldn't. She stayed\nby the curb talking to Tito and his friends. Play with the\nkids if you want, she said, I'm staying here. She could be\nstuck-up like that if she wanted to, so I just left.\nIt was her own fault too. When I got back Sally was\npretending to be mad ... something about the boys having\nstolen her keys. Please give them back to me, she said\npunching the nearest one with a soft fist. They were laughing.\nShe was too. It was a joke I didn't get.\nI wanted to go back with the other kids who were still\njumping on cars, still chasing each other through the garden,\nbut Sally had her own game.\nOne of the boys invented the rules. One of Tito's\nfriends said you can't get the keys back unless you kiss us\nand Sally pretended to be mad at first but she said yes. It\nwas that simple.\nI don't know why, but something inside me wanted\nto throw a stick. Something wanted to say no when I\nwatched Sally going into the garden with Tito's buddies all  grinning. It was just a kiss, that's all. A li.ss for each one, So what, she said,\nOnly how come I felt angry inside. Like something\nwasn't right. Sally went behind that old blue pickup to Usa\nthe boys and get her keys back, and I ran up three flights\nof stairs to where Tito lived. His mother was ironing shirts.\nShe was sprinkling water on them from an empty pop bottle\nand smoking a cigarette.\nYour son and his friends stole Sally's keys and now\nthey won't give them back unless she kisses them and right\nnow they're making her kiss them, I said all out of breath\nfrom the three flights of stairs.\nThose kids, she said, not looking up from her ironing.\nThat's all?\nWhat do you want me to do, she said, call the cops?\nAnd kept on ironing.\nI looked at her a long time, but couldn't think of\nanything to say, and ran back down the three flights to the\ngarden where Sally needed to be saved. I took three big\nsticks and a brick and figured this was enough.\nBut when I got there Sally said go home. Those boys\nsaid leave us alone. I felt stupid with my brick. They all\nlooked at me as if I was the one that was crazy and made\nme feel ashamed.\nAnd then I don't know why but I had to run away. I\nhad to hide myself at the other end of the garden, in the\njungle part, under a tree that wouldn't mind if I lay down\nand cried a long time. I closed my eyes like tight stars so\nthat I wouldn't, but I did. My face felt hot. Everything\ninside hiccupped.\nI read somewhere in India there are priests who can\nwill their heart to stop beating. I wanted to will my blood\nto stop, my heart to quit its pumping. I wanted to be dead.\nto turn into the rain, my eyes melt into the ground like two black snails. I wished and wished. I closed my eyes and\nwilled it, but when I got up my dress was green and I had\na headache.\nI looked at my feet in their white socks and ugly round\nshoes. They seemed far away. They didn't seem to be my\nfeet anymore. And the garden that had been such a good\nplace to play didn't seem mine either.\n\n\n\nRed Clowns\n\nSally, you lied. It wasn't what you said at all. What he\ndid. Where he touched me. I didn't want it, Sally. The way\nthey said it, the way it's supposed to be, all the storybooks\nand movies, why did you lie to me?\nI was waiting by the red clowns. I was standing by the\ntilt-a-whirl where you said. And anyway I don't like carnivals.\nI went to be with you because you laugh on the tilta-whirl,\nyou throw your head back and laugh. I hold your\nchange, wave, count how many times you go by. Those\nboys that look at you because you're pretty. I like to be\nwith you, Sally. You're my friend. But that big boy, where\ndid he take you? I waited such a long time. I waited by the red clowns, just like you said, but you never came, you\nnever came for me.\nSally Sally a hundred times. Why didn't you hear me\nwhen I called? Why didn't you tell them to leave me alone?\nThe one who grabbed me by the arm, he wouldn't let me\ngo. He said I love you, Spanish girl, 1 love you, and pressed\nhis sour mouth to mine.\nSally, make him stop. I cou1,don't make them go away.\nI couldn't do anything but cry. I don't remember. It was\ndark. I don't remember. I don't remember. Please don't\nmake me tell it all.\nWhy did you leave me all alone? I waited my whole\nlife. You're a liar. They all lied. All the books and magazines,\neverything that told it wrong. Only his dirty fingernails\nagainst my skin, only his sour smell again. The moon\nthat watched. The tilt-a-whirl. The red clowns laughing\ntheir thick-tongue laugh.\nThen the colors began to whirl. Sky tipped. Their high\nblack gym shoes ran. Sally, you lied, you lied. He wouldn't\nlet me go. He said I love you, I love you, Spanish girl\n\nLinoleum Roses\n\nSally got married like we knew she would, young and\nnot ready but married just the same. She met a marshmallow\nsalesman at a school bazaar, and she married him\nin another state where it's legal to get married before eighth\ngrade. She has her husband and her house now, her pillowcases\nand her plates. She says she is in love, but I think\nshe did it to escape.\nSally says she likes being married because now she\ngets to buy her own things when her husband gives her\nmoney. She is happy, except sometimes her husband gets\nangry and once he broke the door where his foot went\nthrough, though most days he is okay. Except he won't let\nher talk on the telephone. And he doesn't let her look out\nthe window. And he doesn't like her friends, so nobody\ngets to visit her unless he is working-.\nShe sits at home because she is afraid to go outside without his permission. She looks at all the things they own:\nthe towels and the toaster, the alarm clock and the drapes.\nShe likes looking at the walls, at how neatly their corners meet, the linoleum roses on the floor, the ceiling smooth\nas wedding cake.\n\nThe Three Sisters\n\nThey came with the wind that blows in August, thin\nas a spider web and barely noticed. Three who did not\nseem to be related to anything but the moon. One with\nlaughter like tin and one with eyes of a cat and one with\nhands like porcelain. The aunts, the three sisters, las comadres,\nthey said.\nThe baby died. Lucy and Rachel's sister. One night a\ndog cried, and the next day a yellow bird flew in through\nan open window. Before the week was over, the baby's fever\nwas worse. Then Jesus came and took the baby with him\nfar away. That's what their mother said.\nThen the visitors came ... in and out of the little\nhouse. It was hard to keep the floors clean. Anybody who\nhad ever wondered what color the walls were came and\ncame to look at that little thumb of a human in a box like\ncandy.\nI had never seen the dead before, not for real, not in\nsomebody's living room for people to kiss and bless themselves\nand light a candle for. Not in a house. It seemed\nstrange.\nThey must've known, the sisters. They had the power\nand could sense what was what. They said, Come here, and\ngave me a stick of gum. They smelled like Kleenex or the\ninside of a satin handbag, and then I didn't feel afraid.\nWhat's your name, the cat-eyed one asked.\nEsperanza, I said.\nEsperanza, the old blue-veined one repeated in a high thin voice. Esperanza ... a good good name.\nMy knees hurt, the one with the funny laugh complained.\nTomorrow it will rain.\nYes, tomorrow, they said.\nHow do you know? I asked.\nWe know.\nLook at her hands, cat-eyed said.\nAnd they turned them over and over as if they were\nlooking for something.\nShe's special.\nYes, she'll go very far.\nYes, yes, hmmm.\nMake a wish.\nA wish?\nYes, make a wish. What do you want?\nAnything? I said.\nWell, why not?\nI closed my eyes.\nDid you wish already?\nYes, I said.\nWell, that's all there is to it. It'll come true.\nHow do you know? I asked.\nWe know, we know.\nEsperanza. The one with marble hands called me aside. Esperanza. She held my face with her blue-veined\nhands and looked and looked at me. A long silence. When\nyou leave you must remember always to come back, she\nsaid.\nWhat?\nWhen you leave you must remember to come back\nfor the others. A circle, understand? You will always be\nEsperanza. You will always be Mango Street. You can't\nerase what you know. You can't forget who you are.\nThen I didn't know what to say. It was as if she could\nread my mind, as if she knew what I had'wished for, and\nI felt ashamed for having made such a selfish wish.\nYou must remember to come back. For the ones who\ncannot leave as easily as you. You will remember? She asked\nas if she was telling me. Yes, yes, I said a little confused.\nGood, she said, rubbing my hands. Good. That's all.\nYou can go.\nI got up to join Lucy and Rachel who were already\noutside waiting by the door, wondering what I was doing\ntalking to three old ladies who smelled like cinnamon. I\ndidn't understand everything they had told me. I turned\naround. They smiled and waved in their smoky way.\nThen I didn't see them. Not once, or twice, or ever\nagain.\n\nAlicia & I Talking on Edna\u2019s Steps\n\nI like Alicia because once she gave me a little leather\npurse with the word GUADALAJARA stitched on it, which\nis home for Alicia, and one day she will go back there. But\ntoday she is listening to my sadness because I don't have a\nhouse.\nYou live right here, 4006 Mango, Alicia says and\npoints to the house I am ashamed of.\nNo, this isn't my house 1 say and shake my head as if\nshaking could undo the year I've lived here. I don't belong. I don't ever want to come from here. You have a home,\nAlicia, and one day you'll go there, to a town you remem\u00adber, but me I never had a house, not even a photograph ... only one I dream of.\nNo, Alicia says. Like it or not you are Mango Street\nand one day you'll come back too.\nNot me. Not until somebody makes it beucr.\nWho's going to do it? The mayor?\nAnd the thought of the mayor coming to Mango Street makes me laugh out loud.\nWho's going to do it? Not the mayor.\n\nA House of My Own\n\nNot a Rat. Not an apartment in back. Not a man's\nhouse. Not a daddy\u00b7s. A house all my own. With my porch\nand my pillow, my pretty purple petunias. My books and my stories. My two shoes waiting beside the bed. Nobody\nto shake a stick at. Nobody's garbage to pick up after.\nOnly a house quiet as snow, a space for myself to go,\nclean as paper before the poem.\n\nMango Says Goodbye Sometimes\n\nI like to tell stories. I tell them inside my head. I tell them after the mailman says, Here's your mail Here's your\nmail he said.\nI make a story for my life, for each step my brown\nshoe takes. I say, \"And so she trudged up the wooden stairs,\nher sad brown shoes taking her to the house she never\nliked.\"\nI like to tell stories. I am going to tell you a story about\na girl who didn't want to belong.\nWe didn't always live on Mango Street. Before that\nwe lived on Loomis on the third floor, and before that we\nlived on Keeler. Before Keeler it was Paulina, but what I remember most is Mango Street, sad red house, the house\nI belong but do not belong to.\nI put it down on paper and then the ghost does not\nache so much. I write it down and Mango says goodbye\nsometimes. She does not hold me with both arms. She sets\nme free.\nOne day I will pack my bags of books and paper. One\nday I will say goodbye to Mango. I am too strong for her\nto keep me here forever. One day I will go away.\nFriends and neighbors will say, What happened to\nthat Esperanza? Where did she go with all those books and\npaper? Why did she march so far away?\nThey will not know I have gone away to come back.\nFor the ones I left behind. For the ones who cannot out.2Embed"
