Lyrics[Intro: B\u0113kon]\nLove's gonna get you killed\nBut pride\u2019s gonna be the death of you and you and me\nAnd you and you and you and me\nAnd you and you and you and me\nAnd you and you and you and me and\u2014\n\n[Chorus: Steve Lacy & Kendrick Lamar]\nMe, I wasn't taught to share, but care\nIn another life, I surely was there\nMe, I wasn't taught to share, but care\nI care, I care\n\n[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]\nHell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldly possessions\nFlesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?\nThe better part, the human heart, you love \u2019em or dissect 'em\nHappiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?\nSee, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world\nI don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world\nI don't love people enough to put my faith in man\nI put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band\nI understand I ain't perfect, I probably won't come around\nThis time I might put you down\nLast time I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now\nMy feelings might go numb, you're dealin\u2019 with cold thumb\nI\u2019m willin' to give up a leg and arm to show empathy from\nPity parties and functions of you and yours\nA perfect world, you probably live another 24\nI can\u2019t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure\nI can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure\nYou might also like[Chorus: Steve Lacy & Kendrick Lamar]\nMe, I wasn\u2019t taught to share, but care\nIn another life, I surely was there\nMe, I wasn't taught to share, but care\nI care, I care\n[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]\nMaybe I wasn't there (We saw you first)\nMaybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)\nMaybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)\nMaybe I wasn't there\n\n[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]\nNow, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive\nCold as December but never remember what winter did\nI wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid\nSeems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays\nSmiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there\nIndigenous disposition, feel like we belong here\nI know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back\nThe hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that\nSick venom in men and women overcome with pride\nA perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies\nPromises are broken and more resentment come alive\nRace barriers make inferior of you and I\nSee, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches\nI'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison\nI'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service\nJust to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world\n[Chorus: Steve Lacy & Kendrick Lamar]\nMe, I wasn't taught to share, but care\nIn another life, I surely was there\nMe, I wasn't taught to share, but care\nI care, I care\n[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]\nMaybe I wasn't there (We saw you first)\nMaybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)\nMaybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)\nMaybe I wasn't there170Embed"
