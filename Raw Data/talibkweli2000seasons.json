Stop lookin' everywhere else\nSpeakin' of plannin'\nHustlin' and schemin' or lookin' for hookups\nTook up too much time\nYou like a fiend for rocks that got cooked up\nGod bless the child that got his own shit!\nI got my team's, so the fiends now become opponents\nThey the opposition, stronger from competition\nShinin' like a golden shower, your face I'm pissin' in\nCompletin' a genocide mission like The Warren commission\nLike fathers who's supposed to be missin'\nWhile our sisters was supposed to be whorin'\nSave it for a rainy day, money is pourin'\nUnder grey clouds, black butterflies still be soarin'\nFlyin' in the friendly skies, we classifyin' our highs\nBlood be flowin' through the streets like crimson tide in my eyes\nThai be havin' me drowsy, but I get mellow with the chronic\nIntellectuals embarrassed 'cause we discussin' Ebonics\nI'm on a roll like Sonic\nIn a age that the plague got bubonic proportions\nYo, I call it reparations, but they call it extortion\nWhatever! Just give me mine, but caution\nYou've been warned for the very last time\nI'm not tellin' you again\nSo relay it to your crew, you gotta actually to do\nForget the drive-in, drive-by and drive thru\nYou've gotta get out the car\nHumble yourself, tilt your head back and look at the stars\nShinin' over someplace very far from where you standin'\nWhen the night is clear\nYou understanding just who put them there\nWhat you know about the space you get lost in?\nYour peoples can't hear you in the distortion\nThe desert is absorption\nYou sucked and you stuck in off American freezin'\nFor like 2000 seasons\nAnd upon your return from rapin' and crossbreedin'\nYour own people accuse you of deceivin' and misleadin'\nAnd causin' mass confusion, drug abusin'\nNow you all caught up in institutions\nAt this time, you've got to break it down\nAnd be showin' and provin'\nAn A&R told me that I use too many catchphrases\nTrue! I'm tryin' to catch all my people in all different stages...\nAll different phases...\n[Outro]\nIt's like that, y'all\nIt's like this, y'all\nYou don't stop!\nKeep it goin', y'all\nReflection, yo!\nWe freak it like this\nYou don't stop\nHere we go, y'all3Embed"
