Man, how 'bout you?\nTo be free, to be sold\nTo be killed, to be safe\nIn my head, I'm alone\nI'm not dead, I'm ashamed\nJust like you, I've been trying to escape\nIn my bones, I feel cold\nI give thanks to the Lord\nIndustry, in the street\nLet me go, let me be\nI don't need to be here\nI'm alone, can't you see? Can't you see?\n[Chorus]\nI don't think you understand\nThere's nowhere left to turn, these walls keep breaking\nTime is like a leaf in the wind\nEither it's time well spent or time I've wasted\nDon't waste it30Embed"
