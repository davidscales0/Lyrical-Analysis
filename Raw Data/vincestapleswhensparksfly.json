Did we make mistakes?\nCan't drop on your bail, can't check on your case\nKnow that you won't tell, that's why I'm afraid\nYou'll probably never get to see the light of day\nI'm ashamed to say I think I hate you now\nWe should've took 'em on a chase 'cause I can't save you now\nAt least give me a chance to try to lay 'em down\nIs you trippin'? You forgettin' that we made these vows?\nStill here I am, waiting 'round\nDreaming that you comin' home, right your wrongs, take me out\nI can't wait until you bust it down\nProbably go a hunnid rounds\n[Outro: Lyves, Woman Speaking]\nI keep calling\nI keep calling (Oh, ooh)\nI keep calling\nI keep calling\nI keep calling (Oh, ooh)\nI keep calling\nI keep calling\nI keep calling (Oh, ooh)\nI keep calling\nI like him 'cause, you know, 'cause...\n'Cause I know [?] when somebody go back for me\nWe'll be back together and we can have a little fun\nBut he's in jail right now\nFor something that he had no business in doin'\n\"What did he do?\"\nThey said he killed somebody11Embed"
