Oh Tip, man, why you do that to me, man?\nI though he was a friend, bruh\nOh man, can't believe that\nOh, why you do that to me?\nI wouldn't do it like this\nI couldn't do it by myself\nYo, it's [?] it to my [?]\n\n[Verse 2: Q-Tip]\nAre you ready, Lu? This one is for you\nComin' from a true-blue, fits like a shoe\n\"\u00bfC\u00f3mo est\u00e1 usted?\" or \"Comment allez-vous\"\nLucien, I'll leave it up to you\nVoulez-vous? (vous)\nRendez-vous (vous)\nCoucou (cou)\nLes poupous (pou)\nWatch that lass, gonna backlash fast\nCan you get a grip on the crackhead dip?\nSold you a paper bag, guess he saw you comin'\nVCR from a neck-bone bummin'\n$10 brother, he was hummin' and strummin'\nOnly had 20, he was livin' like ya slummin'\nGave him the money, well, I thought that was somethin'\nLookin' like a kid who was lost in crumbin'\nDon't worry about a thing, I won't get specific\nThis is a song that is long and prolific\nThink of the stuff that I said if you can\nFigure it out, compute, understand\nNo problemo, I'll help you with your demo\nIf you go to the store for me\nLucien, I'm just kiddin'\nYou should know!\n[Break: Lucien]\n- Hey, yo, wassup' man? What's your name?\n- What kind of accent is that?\n- It's a french accent, you know, I'm french, I'm from France, don't you think it's sexy?\n- No, it's not a sexy accent\n- Oh, don't you like it? Why? You try to diss me, what? Hun? Oh please what! Love means french, french means love, everybody love my accent! Why nobody like it? Q-Tip write a story about me- why is that? Oh! I'm sexy, and I'm french, everybody love my accent, I'm the best, yes, yeah! Je t'aime! I love you! I love you oui, je t'aime! I'll teach you french, I'll make your french good!\n\n[Verse 3: Q-Tip]\nYou gotta get a grip on the missions you'll be takin'\nNot so much the mission, but you got crazy ignition\nSure, the sugar-babies wanna give you a chance\nWith the French \"savoir faire\" and the sexy glance\nBut is she really fly, or is she a guy?\nI won't ask why, 'cause I know that you try\nYou try too hard, is that the answer to the riddle?\nInstead of doin' so much, why don't you do just a little?\nBoy, what a cad, I guess we shouldn't treat him bad\nIn fact, it would be nice if we understood him, right?\nA case of positionin' the feet in the shoes\nSympathetic reason in the case of the blues\nLucien is blue, even though he's really brown\nI had to make the sound, his life is too profound\nOn the up-and-up, he's somethin' like a little pup\nYoung and naive, it's hard to believe\nAs long as you're strong, you can quest with the Questers\nJolly like a jumping bean or a jester\nLucien, Lucien, Lucien, Lucien\nYou should know!\n[Break: Lucien]\nOh Tip, everything, you gonna be alright, man\nThank you, I should listen to you, man\nI think I'll going home, man\nBye-bye, I'll see you tonight\nOh Tip, [?], I'm outta here21Embed"
