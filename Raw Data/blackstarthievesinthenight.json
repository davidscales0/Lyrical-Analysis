Come on, yeah\n\n[Verse 1: Talib Kweli & Both]\n\"Give me the fortune, keep the fame\" said my man Louis, I\nAgreed, know what he mean because we live the truest lie\nI asked him why we follow the law of the bluest eye\nHe looked at me, thought about it, was like, \"I'm clueless, why?\"\nThe question was rhetorical, the answer is horrible\nOur morals are out of place and got our lives full of sorrow\nAnd so, tomorrow comin' later than usual\nWaitin' on someone to pity us\nWhile we find the beauty in the hideous\nThey say money's the root of all evil, but I can't tell\nYou know what I mean? Pesos, francs, yens, cowrie shells\nDollar bills, or is it the mind-state that's ill?\nCreatin' crime rates to fill the new prisons they build\nOver money and religion, there's more blood to spill\nThe wounds of slaves in cotton fields that never heal\nWhat's the deal?\nA lot of cats who buy records are straight broke\nBut my language universal, they be recitin' my quotes\nWhile R&B singers hit bad notes, we rock the boat of thought\nThat my man Louis' statements just provoked\nCaught up in conversations of our personal worth\nBrought up through endangered species status on the planet Earth\nSurvival tactics means bustin' gats to prove you hard\nYour firearms are too short to box with God\nWithout faith, all of that is illusionary\nRaise my son \u2014 no vindication of manhood necessary\nYou might also like[Chorus: Mos Def, Talib Kweli & Both]\nNot strong, only aggressive\nNot free, we only licensed\nNot compassionate, only polite\nNot who the nicest\nNot good, but well behaved\nChasin' after death so we can call ourselves brave?\nStill livin' like mental slaves\nHidin' like thieves in the night from life\nIllusions of oasis makin' you look twice\nHidin' like thieves in the night from life\nIllusions of oasis makin' you look twice\n\n[Verse 2: Mos Def & Both]\nYo, I'm sure that everybody out listenin' agree\nThat everythin' you see ain't really how it be\nA lot of jokers out runnin' in place, chasin' the style\nBe a lot goin' on beneath the empty smile\nMost cats in my area be lovin' the hysteria\nSynthesized surface conceals the interior\nAmerica \u2014 land of opportunity\nMirages and camouflages more than usually\nSpeakin' loudly, sayin' nothin', you confusin' me, you losin' me\nYour game is twisted, want me enlisted in your usury\nFoolishly, most men join the ranks cluelessly\nBuffoonishly accept the deception, believe the perception\nReflection rarely seen across the surface of the looking glass\nWalkin' the street, wonderin' who they be lookin' past\nLookin' gassed with them imported designer shades on\nStars shine bright, but the light rarely stays on\nSame song \u2014 just remixed, different arrangement\nPut you on a yacht, but they won't call it the slave ship\nStrangeness, you don't control us, you barely hold this\nScreamin' \"Brand new!\", when they just sanitized the old shit\nSuppose it's just another clever Jedi mind trick\nThat they been runnin' across stars through all the time with\nI find it's distressin', there's never no in-between\nWe either niggas or Kings, we either bitches or Queens\nThe deadly ritual seems immersed in the perverse\nFull of short attention spans, short tempers and short skirts\nLong barrel automatics released in short bursts\nThe length of black life is treated with short worth\nGet yours first, them other niggas secondary\nThat type of illin' that be fillin' up the cemetery\nThis life is temporary, but the soul is eternal\nSeparate the real from the lie \u2014 let me learn you\nNot strong, only aggressive 'cause the power ain't directed\nThat's why we are subjected to the will of the oppressive\nNot free \u2014 we only licensed, not live \u2014 we just excitin'\n'Cause the captors own the masters to what we writin'\nNot compassionate, only polite \u2014 we well trained\nOur sincerity's rehearsed in stage, it's just a game\nNot good, but well behaved, 'cause the cameras survey\nMost of the things that we think, do or say\nWe chasin' after death just to call ourselves brave\nBut everyday, next man meet with the grave\nI give a damn if any fan recall my legacy\nI'm tryin' to live life in the sight of God's memory\nLike that, y'all\n[Interlude: Mos Def & Talib Kweli]\nA lot of people don't understand the true criterion of things\nCan't just accept the appearance, have to get the true essence\nThey ain't lookin' around\n[Chorus: Talib Kweli, Mos Def, & Both]\nNot strong, only aggressive\nNot free, we only licensed\nNot compassionate, only polite\nNot who the nicest\nNot good, but well behaved\nChasin' after death so we can call ourselves brave\nStill livin' like mental slaves\nHidin' like thieves in the night from life\nIllusions of oasis makin' you look twice\nHidin' like thieves in the night from life\nIllusions of oasis makin' you look twice\nHidin' like thieves in the night from life\nIllusions of oasis makin' you look twice\nHidin' like thieves in the night from life\nIllusions of oasis makin' you look twice\n\n[Bridge: Mos Def & Talib Kweli]\nStop hidin', stop hidin'\nStop hidin' yo' face (Yes, c'mon)\nStop hidin', stop hidin' (Celebratin' death)\n'Cause ain't no hidin' place\nStop hidin', stop hidin'\nStop hidin' yo' face\nStop hidin', stop hidin' 'cause ain't no hidin' place\nSay, say it ain't no hidin' place (Not strong)\nSay, say it ain't no hidin' place (Not free)\nSay it ain't no hidin' place (Not compassionate)\nSay it ain't no hidin' place!\nSay it ain't no hidin' place (We well trained)\nBetter stop hidin' yo' face (Black Star)\nStop hidin', stop hidin' (Black Star keep shinin')\nStop hidin' yo' face (Yo, yo, yo)\n[Outro: Talib Kweli & Mos Def]\nWe take that Black Star line right on home\nBe real, be true\nWe take that Black Star line right on home\nKeep shinin'!\nWe take that Black Star line right on home\nBe real, be true\nWe take that Black Star line right on home\nKeep shinin'!39Embed"
