Tonight\nThen he pulled up around nine\nText, \u201cCan't you see me blud? I'm outside\u201d\nQuickly jump in my Nikes, hardly need to change clothes\nWalk out the door to see mumsy nagging askin' me to stay home\n(Steups) No\n\n[Chorus]\nMan I got hoes some days\nAnd wanna be alone some days\nTrue say I be at home some days\nAnd drillin' with the bros some days (Drillin')\nWe was on the field and the no go ends\nWhile you're chilling with your mum at home (Home, home, home)\nThree man up in a four-door Benz\nWhile you\u2019re chilling with your mum at home (Home, home, home)\nCan't you see London's burning?\nAnd you can't duck this smoke (Burn)\nMan know 'bout serving\nMan know 'bout the pot and stove (Aye, aye, aye)\nFeel like I been on the road most days\nBut true say I never been home (Home, home, home)\nMum told me, \"Come home,\" some days\nBut true say I never did go (Go)\nWait, true say I never did\u2014\n[Verse 3]\nAight, certi, touched at 11:30\nWent and stopped at my bredrin's yard, weren't tryna to get there too early\nMy bredrins say when I drink this hard, then a minor issue will stir me\nThen I turned my head and see Anna, with some guy that's moving too thirsty\nLike, \"Where did they find this donny?\nLadies man yeah? Think man's funny?\nCome we get him wrapped, come and take man's money\nMatter of fact mans gonna confront him\"\nWalked up, pushed him and said, \"What's good?\"\nLooked at me confused and he said, \"Nothing\"\nShe was like, \"Babes wait stop it\"\nWeren't gonna ching man, I was just bluffing\nBut I can't just stand there discussin'\nLeast not in front of Anna\nGotta come badder\nMatter of fact, matter of fact\nWhere's man's dagger?\nWhat did it drop in the car from my pocket\nNah wait, nah wait, my dog has got it\nThen out of the blue\nWent and put it in his right hand\nThen he dipped my man right in the stomach (Shit)\nNow they got man running\nOn my life, I taste vomit\nTen toes to the Benz, man I ended up throwin' up on the bonnet\nNow I hear sirens, while we were tryna zing up the road\nThen I looked down and I see bare missed calls\nThat's mumsy ringing my phone\nI shoulda went home\n[Chorus]\nMan I got hoes some days\nAnd wanna be alone some days\nTrue say I be at home some days\nAnd drillin' with the bros some days (Drillin')\nWe was on the field and the no go ends\nWhile you're chilling with your mum at home (Home, home, home)\nThree man up in a four-door Benz\nWhile you\u2019re chilling with your mum at home (Home, home, home)\nCan't you see London's burning?\nAnd you can't duck this smoke (Burn)\nMan know 'bout serving\nMan know 'bout the pot and stove (Aye, aye, aye)\nFeel like I been on the road most days\nBut true say I never been home (Home, home, home)\nMum told me, \"Come home,\" some days\nBut true say I never did go (Go)\nWait, true say I never did\u2014\n\n[Outro]\nAn update has just come in on the incident\nThe police have apprehended three suspects caught speeding in a black Mercedes, a couple of miles from the stabbing\nLet's go over to our correspondent who is currently live at the scene14Embed"
