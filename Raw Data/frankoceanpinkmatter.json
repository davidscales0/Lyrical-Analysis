I need to hold your hand\nYou'd need no other man, we'd flee to other lands\n[Bridge: Frank Ocean]\nGrey matter\nBlue used to be my favorite color\nNow I ain't got no choice\nBlue matter\n[Outro: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nYou're good at being bad, you're bad at being good\nFor heaven's sakes, go to hell, nah, knock on wood, hey\nYou're good at being bad (You're bad at being good)\nFor heaven's sakes, go to hell (Knock on wood)\nFor heaven's sakes, go to hell\nKnock, knock, knock, knock on wood\nWell, frankly, when that ocean so mu'fucking good\nMake her swab the mu'fucking wood\nMake her walk the mu'fucking plank\nMake her rob a mu'fucking bank\nWith no mask on and a rusty revolver287Embed"
