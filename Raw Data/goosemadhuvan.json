Which one's the way?\nLust\nLost his trust\nNow roams the barren dunes\nBones continue to rust\nUp and down, up and down\nUp and down, up and down\nWe go\nAlways almost there\n\nThat ledge is the only thing I ever see\nWorn so hollow from that shadow over me\nBoundless above my ancient holds it close\nOver, still closer than I've ever known\n\nWell, if I had it all, if I had it all\nWhat life would leave me satisfied?\nAll of this gold, all of this gold\nIt don't weigh enough to make this life\nWhole\nYou might also likeShelter\nSomething felt\nSure\nMolten beads of his lotus feet\nDangle by his belt\nPure, pure, pure\nBhagavatam\nDhruva, Madhuvan\nDeep into the forest\nHe will go\nNo more demon roars\n\nThat ledge is the only thing I ever see\nBorn in the heat to keep it always out of my reach\nGrab on a hold each treasure while you go\nBefore they turn to sand, this man is all alone\n\nIf I had it all, if I had it all\nWhat life would leave me satisfied?\nAll of this gold, all of this gold\nDon't weigh enough to make this life wholeEmbed"
