bubbly, pour that bubbly\nPour that bubbly\nWe done went through too much, you hear me?\n(8-8-8-8-808 Mafia)\n\n[Refrain]\nPour that bubbly\nDrink that muddy, drink is muddy when we covered in it\nYeah, I'm covered in it\nI was thuggin' it, I was just loving lit\nThat's for them other niggas, that's for the other bitches\nThat ain't for you, dawg, that's for them other niggas\nThat ain't for you, shawty, that's for that other bitch\nI'm going crazy 'bout it, I'm going codeine crazy\nThat's how I'm living it, I'm feeling lovely\nI'm drinking bubbly\nI'm drinking bubbly (Yeah)\n\n[Verse 1]\nTake all my problems and drink out the bottle and fuck on a model, yeah\nAudemars, this not a carnival, this is a Royal Oak Cartier\nDom Perignon, I get down from a brown, I get chauffeured around\nI pour up with my rounds, I pour up out of town\nI corrupted your town with them guns and them pounds\nI grew up on the grounds with them dealers and hounds\nWe order more bottles and fuck on more models and pass 'em around\nI say everything triple time\nRollie, AP, Hublot, triple time\nI just know the ones you call upon\nI just had to pay my dawg a bond\nLooking at me like a triple threat\nEvery time a nigga talk, a check\nSmoke the kush up like a cigarette\nRun it back, you hear my intellect (8-8-8-8-808 Mafia)\nSee Future LiveGet tickets as low as $49You might also like[Bridge]\nCelebrating like the championship\nCelebrating like the championship\nCelebrate like the championship\nCelebrate like the championship\nI told you, I told you, I told you, I told you\nHahah, celebrate\n\n[Verse 2]\nDon't tell me you celibate to the mula\nI just went Rick the Ruler with the jeweler\nI just went St. Tropez-in' like a goonie\nAbu Dhabi, nigga straight out the sewer\nLike a loaded chopper, I'm 'bout to shoot it\nI'm so fucking sick and tired of these rumors\nI just dived inside a cutie, we spoonin'\nTake it back and take a look at yourself\nTake the lesson, put it all in the air\nToo many days gone by\nSittin' by the phone, waitin' 'til I reply\nDrying my eyes, believe it or not\nI could never see a tear fallin'\nWater drippin' on me like a faucet\nI just took a bitch to eat at Chipotle\nSpent another sixty thousand on a Rollie\nAll my diamonds got you brainwashed\nShe sucked my dick, it got my brain washed\nAnd for that shit, you got your man popped\nSee what they did to Biggie and Pac\nPour a lil', lil' liquor out, pour a lil' more liquor out\nPour it out, pour it out, pour it out\n[Chorus]\nCodeine crazy, codeine crazy\nCodeine crazy, codeine crazy\nCodeine crazy, codeine crazy\nAll this motherfucking money got me codeine crazy\n\n[Verse 3]\nDrownin' in Actavis, suicide\nWhen I hit the scene, it's homicide\nDiamond pinky ring a lollipop\nFuck the hate, I pull up in a drop\nDiamonds colder than a glacier\nBallin' harder than the Pacers\nI been tryin' to have some patience\nTold my mama she should pray on it\nTold the streets they gotta wait on it\nShe gon' put a nigga name on it\nI just dropped a whole thang on it\nI'm making USD's overseas\nThat's U.S. dollars that you can't achieve\nFucked my white girl, she said, \"Nigga, please\"\nFuck that white girl, she said, \"Nigga, please\"\nPlayin' poker, now we're back in Stroker\nI forgot her name but her pussy soakin'\nWhen I seen her on the pole\nReminded myself when I used to come over\nReminded myself when I used to get loaded\nRemindin' myself that I'm still gettin' loaded\nThe coupe fully loaded, this whip fully loaded\nThis whip fully loaded, the clip fully loaded\nI try to control it\nLet's wrap up some bottles, let's pop off some bottles, these niggas too bogus\nLet's pour up a pint, I'ma fuck around, faint like I'm Kid Cudi, probably\nI fuck around, faint, I'ma fall on the drank\nRockin' Tom Ford, poppin' mollies\nMarried to this motherfuckin' money\n[Chorus]\nCodeine crazy, codeine crazy\nCodeine crazy, codeine crazy\nCodeine crazy, codeine crazy\nAll this motherfucking money got me codeine crazy\n\n[Verse 4]\nYou thought I forgot about us?\nI know that you know I don't fold under pressure\nI'm back on the road, I get low on the pedal\nWe live by the codes of the ghetto\nI'm closing this out with my memo\nI'm treating this shit like a demo\nI'm putting my heart and my soul in this shit and some more\nI'm in that Dolce Gabbana\nI might get after Madonna\nI get it crack in the summer\nStrapped in the 'Lac and the Hummer\nFronted a pack to my partner\nAll this lingo got her panties to dropping\nFuck the fame, I'm sipping lean when I'm driving\nAll this cash and it ain't nowhere to hide it\nI'm an addict and I can't even hide it\nDon't you panic, panoramic companion\nThey was tryna serve me at the arraignment\nNever comment on it, never complaining\nI'm taking everything that come with these millions\nI'm taking everything that come with my children\nYeah, yeah\n\n[Refrain]\nPour that bubbly\nDrink that muddy, drink is muddy when we covered in it\nYeah, I'm covered in it\nI was thuggin' it, I was just loving lit\nThat's for them other niggas, that's for the other bitches\nThat ain't for you, dawg, that's for them other niggas\nThat ain't for you, shawty, that's for that other bitch\nI'm going crazy 'bout it, I'm going codeine crazy\nThat's how I'm living it, I'm feeling lovely\nI'm drinking bubbly\n\n[Outro]\nCodeine crazy, codeine crazy\nAll this motherfucking money got me codeine crazy173Embed"
