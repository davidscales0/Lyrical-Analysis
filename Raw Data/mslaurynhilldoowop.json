What\u2019s the difference?\n(Okay. You can love anybody but when you\u2019re in love with somebody you\u2019re looking at it like this\u2014you\u2019re taking that person for what he or she is no matter what he or she look like or no matter what he or she do)\n(You\u2019re crazy! You fall in love, you can fall out of love)\n(You might stop being in love with them but you are not gonna stop loving that person)\n(Maybe they ain\u2019t never been loved before or been in love before, they don\u2019t know what the feeling is to be loved)\n(She poetic)\nShe killed it, we could end that conversation with that, right?94Embed"
