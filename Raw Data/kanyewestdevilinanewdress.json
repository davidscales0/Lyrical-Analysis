Oh, she lose it\nShe putting on her makeup, she casually allure\nText message break-ups, the casualty of tour\nHow she gon' wake up and not love me no more?\nI thought I was the asshole, I guess it's rubbin' off\nHood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme\nHard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron\nI'm looking at her like, \"This what you really wanted, huh?\"\nWhy we argue anyway? Oh, I forgot, it's summertime\nYou might also like[Chorus: Kanye West]\nPut your hands to the constellations\nThe way you look should be a sin, you my sensation\nI know I'm preachin' to the congregation\nWe love Jesus, but she done learned a lot from Satan\nSatan, Satan, Satan\nI mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting\nWe ain't married, but tonight I need some consummation\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nWhen the sun go down, it's the magic hour, the magic hour\nAnd outta all the colors that'll fill up the skies\nYou got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes\nWhy you standing there with your face screwed up?\nDon't leave while you're hot, that's how Mase screwed up\nThrowin' shit around, the whole place screwed up\nMaybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us\nI hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat\nI ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat\nYou see, I always loved that sense of humor\nBut tonight, you should have seen how quiet the room was\nThe Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme\nThat's \"Dior Homme,\" not \"Dior, homie\"\nThe crib Scarface, could it be more Tony?\nYou love me for me, could you be more phony?\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nPut your hands to the constellations\nThe way you look should be a sin, you my sensation\nHaven't said a word, haven't said a word to me this evening\nCat got your tongue?\n[Instrumental Interlude: Mike Dean Guitar Solo]\n[Verse 3: Rick Ross]\nLookin' at my bitch, I bet she give your ass a bone\nLookin' at my wrist, it'll turn your ass to stone\nStretch limousine, sipping ros\u00e9 all alone\nDouble-headed monster with a mind of his own\nCherry-red chariot, excess is just my character\nAll-black tux, nigga's shoes lavender\nI never needed acceptance from all you outsiders\nHad cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired (Uh)\nBefore his jaw shattered, climbing up the Lord's ladder\nWe still speedin', running signs like they don't matter, uh\nHater talkin' never made me mad\nNever that, not when I'm in my favorite paper tag\nTherefore, G4s at the Clearport\nWhen it come to tools, fool, I'm a Pep Boy\nWhen it came to dope, I was quick to export\nNever tired of ballin', so it's on to the next sport\nNew Mercedes sedan, the Lex' sport\nSo many cars, DMV thought it was mail fraud\nDifferent traps I was gettin' mail from\nPolk County, Jacksonville, right in Melbourne\nWhole clique appetites had tapeworms\nSpinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my J burns\nI shed a tear before the night's over\nGod bless the man I put this ice over (Uh)\nGetting 2Pac money twice over\nStill a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice-roller\nI'm makin' love to the angel of death\nCatchin' feelings, never stumble, retracin' my steps (Uh)\nUh220Embed"
