Yeah, yeah\nLay your hand across my face,\u2005yeah,\u2005yeah\nTime we lost,\u2005that's all my fault\n\n[Chorus]\nPlease don\u2019t be\u2005long, 'cause I want you now\nI don't have love without you around\nLife is too short, but I will live for you\n\n[Verse 2]\nHow did this fit in your story? Yeah-eah\nWhy\u2019d you let them judge your body? Yeah-eah\nI'll be waitin' there outside, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nPlease don't be long, 'cause I want your all\nI don't have fun without your love\nLife is too short, but I will live for you\nYou're mucking off, but I will live for you, my selfless love\n\n[Bridge]\nBite my tongue, I wait my turn\nI waited for a century\nWaste my breath, no lessons learned\nI turn and face the enemy\nI'm not scared, just don\u2019t care\nI\u2019m not listening, you hear?\nHe's never there, but I don\u2019t care\nI can't tell you what and where\nYou might also like[Outro]\nYeah-eah\nYeah-eah27Embed"
