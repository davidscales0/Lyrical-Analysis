Who fell? Who goes to jail? Who don't and is free?\n\n[Chorus]\n\"Did you ever hear the story 'bout Leon?\"\nI said \"Leon?\", they said \"Leon\"\nHe was from the flats that the jack kids be on\nBefore the cats th\u0435re had the crack to fiend on\nTh\u0435y say on the street he a phenom\nWhen he squeeze dons it's phenomenal\nMake a change off a name like a hitman\nAnd will hit man if it's reasonable\n\n[Verse 1]\nThey all have the same reason to call\nOh, what a big misfortune if blank ceases to breathe anymore\nMac on the mantel, teeth in the drawer\nIf you ask him, he'll call it his callin'\nCourse he's the one that's receiving the call\nIf a price on your head in the mornin'\nCall money up like there's Ps on the wall\nWhen the payment is set, just need a name and address\nA couple pictures never hurt\nMan wanna be certain he aimin' correct\nA scar on his arm and the nape of the neck\nAnd a big one goin' along the torso\nFrom when the boys tried snake him in west\nThat calass got repaid in flesh\nYou might also like[Chorus]\n\"Did you ever hear the story 'bout Leon?\"\nI said \"Leon?\", they said \"Leon\"\nHe was from the flats that the jack kids be on\nBefore the cats there had the crack to fiend on\nThey say on the street he a phenom\nWhen he squeeze dons it's phenomenal\nMake a change off a name like a hitman\nAnd will hit man if it's reasonable\n\n[Verse 2]\nLogic and reason one thing he prees, every man's got a code\nNever hit children or women and don't bring t'ings to your humble abode\nHe caught most of his bodies alone\nBodies in storage, bodies at home\nFeds on the mission to catch man slippin'\nBy time they sniffin' along, man's ghost\nBro, who do you suppose I could go to and talk 'bout a small little problem?\nMy problems on Princess Road by the junction\nMy hunch is he holds, so don't hold any punches\nHold what? Hold where?\nMan flung on the all black Airs\nTake out a man in his bando and end up wrappin' up all that's theirs\n\n[Chorus]\nDid you ever hear the story 'bout Leon?\nI said \"Leon?\", they said \"Leon\"\nHe was from the flats that the jack kids be on\nBefore the cats there had the crack to fiend on\nThey say on the street he a phenom\nWhen he squeeze dons it's phenomenal\nMake a change off a name like a hitman\nAnd will hit man if it's reasonable\n[Verse 3]\nHe come back one evenin', ain't even get 'round to put keys in the door\nThe ding of the lift when it came to the fifth sent a shiver the kid ain't feelin' before\n\"What, did they finally found my location?\"\n\"Okay then, mans waitin'\"\nDonny gradually opened the door, heard the voice say\n\"Don't move mate, you're goin' to the station\"\nHe always knew one day they would come\nWould go out amazin', blazin' his gun\nHe reached for the piece that he kept on the landin'\nBut mans wasn't playin', and layed him with one\nWhen the fed tried radio it in, man ran for the first window that was open\nHe couldn't survive that fall, are you jokin'?\nBut when he looked out, there was nobody posted\n\n[Chorus]\nDid you ever hear the story 'bout Leon?\nI said \"Leon?\", they said \"Leon\"\nHe was from the flats that the jack kids be on\nBefore the cats there had the crack to fiend on\nThey say on the street he a phenom\nWhen he squeeze dons it's phenomenal\nMake a change off a name like a hitman\nAnd will hit man if it's reasonable4Embed"
