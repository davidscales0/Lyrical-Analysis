You know you do not give\nI got right back on my feet, I fell face first, the first time I'll admit, I did\nTook a couple years for me to feel like I did not fall upon all deaf ears\nNiggas wanna wait, but I call that fear\nAt least I got a place for if all else fails\nNigga, I went on a date, told her call that Lyft\nI told her, \u201cLose my line and don't call back here\"\nYeah, I'm 'bout to lose my mind, I got all that care\nThey listen to me rhyme and can't hold back tears\nGamble on a life, but it won't be fair\nTrade it all for some sand and a beach chair\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nAnd it ain't a ziplock, went and got a wristwatch\nCop'll never respond, anytime I risk my life\nClocking out, the tic toc, watch it all on TikTok\nI'm willin' to bet it all, I'm willin' to risk my life\nAnd it ain't a ziplock, went and got a wristwatch\nCop'll never respond, anytime I risk my life\nClocking out, the tic toc, watch it all on TikTok (TikTok)\nI'm willin' to bet it all, I'm willin' to risk my life6Embed"
