uh-huh (Ayo, is that That Mexican OT?)\n\n[Chorus: That Mexican OT]\nI walk around with a big stick\nIt can make lil' buddy do a backflip (On Crip)\nHundred-round drum, I don't miss shit\nHit his ass up, have his mama throw a bitch fit\nSay he want smoke, push up, you can hit this\nBoss-ass Mexican, I got me a rich bitch\nSlide down his block, I'ma knock off his top\nI'ma reload the Glock, scratch his name off the hitlist\n\n[Verse 1: That Mexican OT]\nI'm that Mexican that they wanna be\nNah, fuck that, I'm the Mexican that they wanna see\nThis that Mexican O to the motherfuckin' T\nPut your
