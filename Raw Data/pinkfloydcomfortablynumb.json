(Hello, hello, hello)\nIs there anybody in there?\nJust nod if you can hear me\nIs there anyone home?\nCome on (Come on, come on), now\nI hear you're feeling down\nWell, I can ease your pain\nAnd get you on your feet again\nRelax (Relax, relax, relax)\nI'll need some information first\nJust the basic facts\nCan you show me where it hurts?\n[Pre-Chorus 1: David Gilmour]\nThere is no pain, you are receding\nA distant ship, smoke on the horizon\nYou are only coming through in waves\nYour lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying\nWhen I was a child, I had a fever\nMy hands felt just like two balloons\nNow I've got that feeling once again\nI can't explain, you would not understand\nThis is not how I am\nYou might also like[Chorus: David Gilmour]\nI have become comfortably numb\n[Guitar Solo 1]\n\n[Chorus: David Gilmour]\nI have become comfortably numb\n[Verse 2: Roger Waters]\nOkay (Okay, okay, okay)\nJust a little pinprick\nThere'll be no more\nBut you may feel a little sick\nCan you stand up? (Stand up, stand up)\nI do believe it's working, good\nThat'll keep you going through the show\nCome on, it's time to go\n[Pre-Chorus 2: David Gilmour]\nThere is no pain, you are receding\nA distant ship, smoke on the horizon\nYou are only coming through in waves\nYour lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying\nWhen I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse\nOut of the corner of my eye\nI turned to look, but it was gone\nI cannot put my finger on it now\nThe child is grown, the dream is gone\n[Chorus: David Gilmour]\nI have become comfortably numb\n[Guitar Solo 2]109Embed"
