Can trial you for fifty quid\nLit his spliff, can he live? Chicks tryna give me pickney\nRisky, risky, my eyes on misty\n\n[Verse]\nThe lengths I would go and protectin' my soul knows no bounds\nDents in the road shook the whole crowd\nI bought a stone foundation and a stone house\nSo if it goes down, the shit's floodin' in then I won't drown\nThey low down, doin' shit I've grown out of\nNo doubter, raw sixth floor, Alpha Houser\nAlways 'round about, I had a pole down my trouser leg\nOnly for if mandem move awkwardly when I'm out the ends\nBut that depends, I'm tryna blow your back as friends\nOff again, smash again, that's your friend? Accident\nActions tend to cause a reaction 'cause I'm passionate\nThey ain't tryna ration it, layin' in the gas they lit\nTrained to be passive in the passa, man are pacifist\nBut pack a fist punch, knuckle sandwich and a bag of chips\nPraised as a myth, young legend and the catalyst\nBut know that who they brand could be the baddest but ain't matchin' with the-\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nThe quick witty, slick drippy, hip with the city kids\nSilly rich ain't he?
