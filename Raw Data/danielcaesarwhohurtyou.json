Lyrics[Verse 1: Daniel Caesar]\nTake me back to Georgia, back to Atlanta\nFunny how present turns past\nI might fly Priscilla out just for 'Bana\nSo mesmerized by that ass\nThe way she moves it I can tell that she loves me\nNigga can't help but to touch\nSmack it 'round a bit then sip on some bubbly\nHope I'm not doing too much\n\n[Refrain: Daniel Caesar]\nStrange new addictions picked up on the road\nChanged my opinions and changed up my flows\nChanged my approach, no more loving these hoes\nAnd when it rains it pours, yeah\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Daniel Caesar]\nYou make me feel so primal and\nThat's what I am, I'm just a man\n\n[Chorus: Daniel Caesar & T-Pain]\nTake that pussy, drop it in my lap\nI love it when you move like that\nNow turn around and throw it back, it back, it back (I'm just a man)\nOh-no-no-no-no-oh-oh\nYou might also like[Verse 2: T-Pain & Daniel Caesar with T-Pain]\nStrippers out in Vegas, New Orleans too\nBooties just don't shake like Priscilla's do\nFollies on a Tuesday, not one but two\nNot one stack or two\nLook at all the cash I blew\nStrippers out in Vegas, New Orleans too\nBooties just don't shake like Priscilla's do\nFollies on a Tuesday, not one but two\nNot one stack or two\nLook at all the cash I blew\n\n[Refrain: Daniel Caesar, T-Pain, & Both]\nStrange new addictions picked up on the road (Oh, up on the road)\nChanged my opinions and changed up my flows (Oh, up my flows)\nChanged my approach, no more loving these hoes (Changed my approach, loving these hoes)\nAnd when it rains it pours, yeah\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Daniel Caesar]\nYou make me feel, yes, so primal and\nThat's what I am, I'm just a man\n\n[Chorus: Daniel Caesar]\nTake that pussy, drop it in my lap\nI love it when you move like that\nNow turn around and throw it back, it back, it back32Embed"
