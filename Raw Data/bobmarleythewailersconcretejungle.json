Concrete jungle (Concrete jungle, jungle, jungle)\nWhy won't you let me be, now ? (Concrete jungle)\nYou might also like[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI said that life (Sweet life)\nIt must be somewhere to be found (Has got to be out there somewhere for me)\nOh, instead of concrete jungle (Jungle, jungle, jungle)\nIllusion (concrete, jungle !)\nConfusion (Concrete, jungle !)\n\n[Outro]\nEh ! Concrete jungle\nYou name it, you've got it in\nConcrete jungle, now (Concrete jungle)\nEh ! Concrete jungle (Jungle, jungle, jungle)\nWhat do you got for me, now ?3Embed"
