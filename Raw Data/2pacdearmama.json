(Dear Mama)\nSweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)\nSweet lady, don't you know we love ya?\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow, ain't nobody tell us it was fair\nNo love for my daddy, 'cause the coward wasn't there\nHe passed away and I didn't cry\n'Cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger\nThey say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along\nI was lookin' for a father, he was gone\nI hung around with the thugs, and even though they sold drugs\nThey showed a young brother love\nI moved out and started really hangin'\nI needed money of my own, so I started slangin'\nI ain't guilty, 'cause even though I sell rocks\nIt feels good puttin' money in your mailbox\nI love payin' rent when the rent is due\nI hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you\n'Cause when I was low you was there for me\nYou never left me alone, because you cared for me\nAnd I could see you comin' home after work late\nYou're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hot plate\nYou just workin' with the scraps you was given\nAnd Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'\nBut now the road got rough, you're alone\nYou're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own\nAnd there's no way I can pay you back\nBut my plan is to show you that I understand\nYou are appreciated\n[Chorus: Reggie Green & Sweet Franklin, 2Pac]\nLady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)\nSweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)\nSweet lady, don't you know we love ya?\n\n[Verse 3]\nPour out some liquor and I reminisce\n'Cause through the drama, I can always depend on my mama\nAnd when it seems that I'm hopeless\nYou say the words that can get me back in focus\nWhen I was sick as a little kid\nTo keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did\nAnd all my childhood memories\nAre full of all the sweet things you did for me\nAnd even though I act crazy\nI gotta thank the Lord that you made me\nThere are no words that can express how I feel\nYou never kept a secret, always stayed real\nAnd I appreciate how you raised me\nAnd all the extra love that you gave me\nI wish I could take the pain away\nIf you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day\nEverything will be alright if you hold on\nIt's a struggle every day, gotta roll on\nAnd there's no way I can pay you back\nBut my plan is to show you that I understand\nYou are appreciated\n[Chorus: Reggie Green & Sweet Franklin, 2Pac]\nLady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)\nSweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)\nSweet lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)\nSweet lady, lady (Dear Mama)\nLady, lady255Embed"
