Percocet got me floatin' like a butterfly, but I'll sting you like a bumblebee

Off-White jeans look like cooked crack

Gave my girl a dub, now her butt fat

I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, I’ll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It’s got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it ""a lot,"" I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
’Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga

I'm with Ced and Lil Baby (Yeah)
We got four choppers that’s full (21)
Way before rappin’, on God, I was trappin', sneakin’ my Glock in Lacura (On God)
I got my K from Osama Bin Laden, lil' nigga, he signed this shit (Straight up)
I'm 4L gang, if you reach for my chain, then a nigga gon' die in this bitch (On God)
A-B-C-D-E-F-G Wagon, y’all niggas doin' that big cappin' (21)
I ain't with the friendly shit
Closest thing y'all gettin' to a handshake is the beat clappin' (21)
Your mama gon' have to make a GoFundMe, y'all niggas keep doing that sneak jabbin' (Straight up)
Gucci had to kill the whole woods
Just to make Young Savage this motherfuckin' mink jacket (21)

VVS look like a star, yeah
I took the top off the car
We don't abide by the law (No)
You don't know what I just saw (Saw)
Can't leave without it (I can't leave without it)
I keep a stick for the war (Stick)
Checks I deposit (Checks I deposit)
Money just stick with the boy

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Cash in and cash out (Cash in and cash out)
I am not lookin' for clout (Nah)
I knew I would figure it out (I knew)
I took the millionaire route (Run it up)
Popped a pill got my head in the cloud (Huh)
Say my name, it'll bring out a crowd (Crowd)
We got paid, now my family proud (On God)
I been drippin' this drip since a child

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
I hit your bitch, she a jump off
Cartier bracelets for her, they don't come off
They get the swag from Atlanta and run off
I make the boys swing the stick like a tomahawk
Runnin' this shit, what the fuck is they talkin' 'bout?
Skinny jeans stuffed with them hundreds, they poke out
S65, I'm in a robot
I'm a real one, ain't running from nobody
Hellcat fast, you know that I show out
Ain't sparin' no bitch, give a fuck 'bout a blowout
If we wanna smoke with you, boy, you can't go out
Still gettin' money my label don't know 'bout
Court-side with the vibe with her toes out
Rich nigga, I come straight out the poor house
Trap goin' crazy right there by Morehouse
Dead end, me, Ced and more ahks
Bought a Benz, doubled back, bought a trap house
I'm with Savage in the 6 doin' donuts (Skrrt)
Youngins with me, they got fire, they gon' go nuts
Quarter-million in a baby blue Goyard
Buy it cash then I go in the motor
Drive fast, ain't no pullin' me over
Play with bags, you can tell by the odor
No alcohol, go get me a new soda
[Chorus: Gunna]
VVS look like a star, yeah
I took the top off the car
We don't abide by the law (No)
You don't know what I just saw (Saw)
Can't leave without it (I can't leave without it)
I keep a stick for the war (Stick)
Checks I deposit (Checks I deposit)
Money just stick with the boy

[Outro: Lil Baby]
Yeah, niggas tryna drip like the boy, yeah
I don't gotta get no award, yeah
Live in the bank, don't do fraud, yeah
200 racks on my arm, yeah
I been fuckin' superstars, yeah
Her pussy good, buy her a car yeah
You niggas ain't makin' no noise, yeah
You niggas ain't makin' no noise (On God)60Embed",0.19829931972789114,0.3392006802721088
