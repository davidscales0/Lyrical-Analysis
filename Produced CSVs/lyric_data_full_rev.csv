2Pac,Do For Love,"102 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsDo For Love Lyrics[Intro: 2Pac]
Turn it up loud
Hahaha, ahahaha, hey, man
You a little sucker for love, Pac!
Word up, hahahahaha (A sucker for love)

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I should've seen you was trouble right from the start, taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began, we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems, but we workin' at it, and now
The arguments are gettin' loud, I wanna stay
But I can't help from walkin' out, just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand if you could see
I never planned to be your man, it just wasn't me
But now I'm searchin' for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don't be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin'
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like, where can I be? You're killin' me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, 'cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin' me to come back, I'm a sucker for love

[Chorus: Eric Williams & 2Pac]
What you won't do, do for love? (That's right, sucker for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up (Sucker for love)
What you won't do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don't give up

Just when I thought I broke away and I'm feelin' happy, you tried to trap me
Said you're pregnant and guess who the daddy? Don't wanna fall for it
But in this case what could I do? So now I'm back
To makin' promises to you, tryna keep it true
What if I'm wrong? A trick to keep me holdin' on
Tryna be strong and in the process, keep you goin'
I'm 'bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin' close
To packin' up and leavin' notes, and gettin' ghost
Tell me who knows a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head, I'm feelin' low, losin' control
My heart is sayin', ""Leave!"" Oh, what a tangled web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin' calls at the house, guess you cheatin'
That's all I need to hear, 'cause I'm leavin', I'm out the door
Never no more you will see me, this is the end
'Cause now I know you've been cheatin', I'm a sucker for love
[Chorus: Eric Williams & 2Pac]
What you won't do, do for love? (Sucker for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up (Don't, sucker for love)
What you won't do, do for love? (Oh, yeah, sucker for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up (Oh, baby)

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hopin' the beatings'll go away
It wasn't always a hit-and-run relationship
It used to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you, a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I should've seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin' tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don't worry 'bout it, we can do it now, I'm under pressure
Make a decision 'cause I'm waitin', when I'm alone
I'm on the phone havin' secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I'm a sucker for love
[Chorus: Eric Williams & 2Pac]
What you won't do, do for love? (What you won't do for love, sucker for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up (That ain't right, I'm a sucker for love)
What you won't do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don't give up (No)

[Outro: Eric Williams & 2Pac]
What you won't do, do for love? (Sucker for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up (Sucker for love)
What you won't do, do for love? (Sucker for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up (Sucker for love)
What you won't do? (Do for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do? (Do for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up
Do for love, yeah, baby, yeah

'Cause that shit don't belong in here
You told me go to Hell 'cause I was drivin' you crazy
Bitch, I will drive you there
Why would I need a stylist to pick out an outfit for me?
I got mad gеar

[Verse 1]
Yeah, stackin' up money like Jеnga and Legos
I sing, but I came with a Glock and a Draco
Back of the crib look like mini Barbados
Losin' my friends every day, I'm okay, though
It's been that way ever since I got famous
We go back like two flats on a Maybach
Money got niggas thinkin' I changed
Why are you makin' this so complicated?
I could buy you a new ass, just say that
Birkins and Tiffany bags, okay then
Still got bitches that owe me some favors
Know a young nigga got racks, baby
Diamonds go blue, like the Mavs, okay then
They can't take my sauce, I got too much flavor
No overexaggeratin'
Don't feel embarrassed
I was flippin' your bitch in the air
Fifty on the veneers
Could've bought like a hundred Monclers
I can't even sleep
The thirties be helpin' me concentrate
She throwin' it back
In the back of my mind, I'm like, ""What if the condom break?""

Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Street poetry is my everyday
But yo, I gotta stop when you trot my way
If I was workin' at the club, you would not pay
Ayo, my man Phife Diggy, he got somethin' to say

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg & Q-Tip]
I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Haitian (Uh)
Name is Phife Dawg from the Zulu Nation
Told you in the jam that we can get down
Now let's knock the boots like the group H-Town
You got BBD all on your bedroom wall
But I'm above the rim and this is how I ball
A gritty little somethin' on the New York street
This is how I represent over this here beat
Talkin' 'bout you, yo, I took you out
But sex was on my mind for the whole damn route
My mind was in a frenzy and a horny state
But I couldn't drop dimes 'cause you couldn't relate

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Stretch out your legs, let me make you bawl
Drive you insane, drive you up the wall
Starin' at your dome-piece, very strong
Stronger than pride, stronger than Teflon
Take you on the Ave and you buy me links
Now I wanna pound the poontang until it stinks
You can be my mama and I'll be your boy

[Verse 4: Phife Dawg & Q-Tip]
Original rude boy, never am I coy
You can be a shorty in my ill convoy
Not to come across as a thug or a hood (What?)
But hun, you got the goods like Madelyne Woods
By the way, my name's Malik, the Five-Foot Freak
Let's say we get together by the end of the week?
She simply said, ""No,"" labeled me a ho
I said, ""How you figure?"" ""My friends told me so""
I hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap
Word to God, hun, I don't get down like that
[Verse 5: Q-Tip & Phife Dawg]
I'll have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak
Or we could do like Uncle L and swing an ep' in my Jeep
Keep it on the down, yo, we keep it discreet
See, I'm not the type of kid to have my biz in the streets
If my mom don't approve, then I'll just elope
Let me save the little man from inside the boat
Let me hit it from the back, girl, I won't catch a hernia
Bust off on your couch, now you got Seaman's Furniture
Shaheed, Phife, and the Extra P
Stacy Beadle, PJ, and my man LG
They know the Abstract is really soul on ice
The character is of men, never ever of mice
Shorty, let me tell you 'bout my only vice
It has to do with lots of lovin' and it ain't nothin' nice

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down (It ain't nothin' nice)
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down (It ain't nothin' nice)

A Tribe Called Quest,Luck of Lucien,"50 ContributorsLuck of Lucien Lyrics[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Brother, brother, brother, Lucien, you're like no other
Listen very close 'cause I don't like to boast
Instead, I'll tell the tale of a French who prevailed
Through the Mr. Crazy Rabbits who were always on his tail
We ain't on sale, your rumor starts to wail
Get caught with stolen goods and you will go to jail
If you go to jail, then who will pay the bail?
Deport you back to France on a ship with a sail
Escargot, Lucien, you eat snails
(Hey yo Tip, what's wrong with snails?)
From the Zulu nation, from a town called Paris
Came to America to find liberty
Instead of finding pleasure, all you found was misery
But listen, Lucien, you have a friend in me
Oh, luck-luck will drive your butt batty
Next time you get some wheels, make it a Caddy
In terms of doing good, I know you wish you really could
But listen, brother man, I really think you can
Succeed with the breed of the brothers on your back
It's the creme de la creme, and you can vouch for that
It'll take a minute, rice, so take my advice
Trust in us, and thus you trust in your life
Lucien, Lucien, Lucien, Lucien
You should know!

- What? Oh Tip, man, why you do that to me, man?
I though he was a friend, bruh
Oh man, can't believe that
Oh, why you do that to me?
I wouldn't do it like this
I couldn't do it by myself
Yo, it's [?] it to my [?]

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Are you ready, Lu? This one is for you
Comin' from a true-blue, fits like a shoe
""¿Cómo está usted?"" or ""Comment allez-vous""
Lucien, I'll leave it up to you
Voulez-vous? (vous)
Rendez-vous (vous)
Coucou (cou)
Les poupous (pou)
Watch that lass, gonna backlash fast
Can you get a grip on the crackhead dip?
Sold you a paper bag, guess he saw you comin'
VCR from a neck-bone bummin'
$10 brother, he was hummin' and strummin'
Only had 20, he was livin' like ya slummin'
Gave him the money, well, I thought that was somethin'
Lookin' like a kid who was lost in crumbin'
Don't worry about a thing, I won't get specific
This is a song that is long and prolific
Think of the stuff that I said if you can
Figure it out, compute, understand
No problemo, I'll help you with your demo
If you go to the store for me
Lucien, I'm just kiddin'
You should know!
[Break: Lucien]
- Hey, yo, wassup' man? What's your name?
- What kind of accent is that?
- It's a french accent, you know, I'm french, I'm from France, don't you think it's sexy?
- No, it's not a sexy accent
- Oh, don't you like it? Why? You try to diss me, what? Hun? Oh please what! Love means french, french means love, everybody love my accent! Why nobody like it? Q-Tip write a story about me- why is that? Oh! I'm sexy, and I'm french, everybody love my accent, I'm the best, yes, yeah! Je t'aime! I love you! I love you oui, je t'aime! I'll teach you french, I'll make your french good!

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
You gotta get a grip on the missions you'll be takin'
Not so much the mission, but you got crazy ignition
Sure, the sugar-babies wanna give you a chance
With the French ""savoir faire"" and the sexy glance
But is she really fly, or is she a guy?
I won't ask why, 'cause I know that you try
You try too hard, is that the answer to the riddle?
Instead of doin' so much, why don't you do just a little?
Boy, what a cad, I guess we shouldn't treat him bad
In fact, it would be nice if we understood him, right?
A case of positionin' the feet in the shoes
Sympathetic reason in the case of the blues
Lucien is blue, even though he's really brown
I had to make the sound, his life is too profound
On the up-and-up, he's somethin' like a little pup
Young and naive, it's hard to believe
As long as you're strong, you can quest with the Questers
Jolly like a jumping bean or a jester
Lucien, Lucien, Lucien, Lucien
You should know!
[Break: Lucien]

Thank you, I should listen to you, man
I think I'll going home, man

And I'm a man of my word, that I got nothin' at all
So tell me now does it hurt or is it too late? I'm a man of my law
I gotta keep my weight up, but who will lean if I fall?
But never mind, I'm fly, you know (Yeah)

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
She the type to seek love and make it everlasting
I'm the type to wake up and say you never happened
I mean, I fucked the girl with hella passion
But it's cold how we smashin', left her sleepin' on a separate mattress
I think her body makes for better practice
Good excuse for my absence like, ""Flacko, where your ass been?
Heard you done with fashion, now your ass is acting""
I'm trippin' off the acid, now your ass is looking massive
This ain't the shit equipped with columns from my reckless swagging
This that dark house party with this record blasting
Rolling spliffs, clique beside me, fingers Liberace
When I seen this bitch in vintage Tommy and some mid Huaraches
I'm all alone though, mood music make me bop slower
Trippin' on how I shifted pop culture, changed hip-hop on you
Smoking like a rasta was my pop's culture

And for the freaks that love the niggas with the Jeeps

When my death calls, I pray the Lord accept collect calls
'Cause I be playin' with these womens like they sex dolls
Call my Prada prior, 'cause it's droppin' next fall
Don't you short the next ball, my closet like the Met ball
She said, ""I just love it when you speak soft-spoken
Up in the magazines with your teeth all golden""
Took the whole year off just to learn to make beats
Dropped the flames on my release and leave the streets all smokin'
Uh, that touch your soul music, I get you higher
Grab your lighter fluid, might add a preacher and a choir to it
I speak the father's music, hallelujah
Always Strive & Prosper, stupid

Sit back and watch me do it

You want that take it to gats or keep it in rappin' talkin'
They rap impulsive, get embarrassed, it actually happens often
You my son like my last abortion, I'm just laughin' off it
I changed rap, pushed fashion forward, yeah, I'm that important
You jack my style, she jack me off, and y'all both actin' awkward?
Jigglin' baby, nah, go 'head, bitch
Ain't nothin' better than the pretty big forehead bitch
Listen close I got some shit to tell you, motherfuckers get familiar
It's not just model bitches on my genitalia
Did Azalea's from Australia, trips to Venezuela
Cinderella's under my umbrella for different weather
Ella, ella, ayy, just play it like I didn't tell you
Niggas takin' pictures any time we get together
And hope to fly away just one day like some love birds
Only one word that I'm afraid of is the ""Love"" word

Sometimes the best advice is no advice
Especially when it's your advice
Oh, man, remember
Your man was on stage dressed like a family member
Man, everything basic to Ye Guevara
That means Saint Laurent is my Zara

We don't gotta switch lanes 'cause we lap dem
I'm a captain, look what the car came wrapped in
No actin', brudda, I'm tapped in
It's Pirelli on the tyres for the traction
Bare garms, but I paid for a fraction
Big back ting, spin it like Jackson
Call me Bronson for the action
Ha, I'm a Mayfair dater
Cat for the accolades, fiend for the paper
Lover, not loser, broke boy hater

Union Jack saviour, wife temptater
I'm the reason your girl's got no behaviour

Bring the wheel up, call me Charles Xaviеr

Bubble bath on her nails, she a Goyard girl
I touched down, but her bro can't tell
She said she love me, but it's a cold-ass world
Say you see me in the dance with the whole cartel
If I'm a player, what does that make you?
I wanna make it right, but does that take two?

You heard what I said, we can run that
Yo Rem, where the drums at?
I'm a money man, I know where the funds at
And if I tump that, I guarantee she gonna come back
I'm in love with your imperfections
Fuck your friends and their interjections
I'm tryna link you and build connections
I'm a dog in the six, pree the interceptions
And when you're with the Gs, dem chill out
The car leather's white, so the drink can't spill out
I'm in the spot, so the gyal get bring out
Run the ting, make the tune get spinout
Bubble bath on her nails, she a Goyard girlie
She could short hair, bob it, or curly
Fresh white toes, and her teeth come pearly
I might have to lock that early

[Chorus]
Bubble bath on her nails, she a Goyard girl
I touched down, but her bro can't tell
She said she love me, but it's a cold-ass world
Say you see me in the dance with the whole cartel
If I'm a player, what does that make you?
I wanna make it right, but does that take two?
Come we vibe for the night, no stress
If you wanna undress, then we can run that too
Bubble bath on her nails, she a Goyard girl
I touched down, but her bro can't tell
She said she love me, but it's a cold-ass world
Say you see me in the dance with the whole cartel

Yeah, my sofa score says 9
Would be 10 if the opps weren't divin'
110 on my wrist I'm thriving
Coat by Clint, I went skydiving
My London heatmap's crazy
I wish that it weren't, I can't go back
Too many goals from central
We went to the party wit' gang and we led the attack
Bad Middle Eastern vibe
She wanted to shop so I gave her a rack
I told as long as she keeps it real
Don't front and I'll pay for the bag
I eat spring rolls in a painted Porsche
Date nights white trufs and pink champagne
And she orders the same of course
My lifestyle's pain endorsed
I can't act like I ain't from the ends with a girl
Cah the whole ting's way too forced
I slime guys out like Malfoy
But she love good, she a Ravenclaw
My margarita's frosty
And the sun's out so her bum's out too
And she brought her friend to the party in a twin dress
That's déjà-vu

I get gassed up when you're dancin'
It's rude to stare so I'm glancin'
Lemme get a chance on your heartstrings
Don't act like it ain't clear what I'm askin'
You could look fly in the estate
Same way you could look fly in the 'burbs
You look sexy in a sundress
Same way you look sexy in my merch
We can do matching whips
Business class on the matching trips
Matching Goyard card holder
Or different jeans with the matching Ricks
I love Japan, so do you
Come be fly, hold the room
I'm the sun, you're the moon
This is my one, I told the goons
Don't let me down
Can't bring your friends if they're not leng
Don't say they are though, that's cap
Cah my darg jus come home again
Got chip in the rizz, ignite it
It's a wave in the spot, don't fight it
It ain't scary in the cut, it's frightening

AJ Tracey,Wifey Riddim,"22 ContributorsWifey Riddim Lyrics[Verse]
Yo, I got this ting from London, West London, Chelsea, near Kings Road
She don't care about my area code
She's about like she ain't aware of the road
And I know twins from Essex
But one of them wants me bad, I might dead it
I don't wife these tings, I'll stress it
Undress it, I go in when I press it
Melina from Brum's Algerian
She's got bare problems, I ain't hearing 'em
She said, ""Baby, my features are yours, and I swear to God, you won't catch me sharing 'em""
Shouts to the girls 'round the UK, peng
Elle, peng, Yasmin, peng
Do a show with my blood bros OT, tell a piff ting that, ""You might see me again""
My light skin don't miss me
'Cause she hates tracksuits that are shifty
I said, ""I wear them 'cause I do road on my 95s, the import's two-fifty""
I got a posh bad ting inna uni
Hollywood like she star in a movie
Her dad's rich, so she's coated in diamonds, eyes are emeralds, and her lipstick's ruby
My close friend, I ain't tryna mash that
But she's a blue foot with a fat backs
LV from her feet to her handbag
But it ain't that, so a nigga gotta hang back
All my ex tings still hate me
They're like, ""Work at it, love, don't pay me""
Hold tight, Jess and Chelsea, they're real, still think Kate's buff, but I don't like Katie
Someone tell Lottie I'ma wife that
Tell her bring her bags 'round my gaff
Got the game tapped like an iPad
Fly in, fly out when I like, fam
Shae, Shyanne and Tina all fluffy
Faces clean, but their minds so dutty
Man are gonna catch me a duppy
Arch their back and give them sick rucky
Girl likes the way that I'm rhyming
Try scratch up my back when I'm piping
Poom, poom fresh up and wet when I'm sliding
Rate that, she's bad with the riding
My girl from Brighton's too pedigree
Doggy that when I'm twist off the Hennessy
She's always cloud nine from the lemony
Check that rarely, she got too much energy
Relationships all get sticky
I need a cute ting like Vicky
I was down south with my bloodline Ets, I linked the honeys and the motive got sticky
I've got a peng ting and she's from Tottenham
True say that the ting lives in Tottenham
In her crib, kept chatting about Arsenal
Piped her, now she's chatting about Tottenham
My new ting's just a weed head
Strong like Mia Cortinez
Stay at hers, fam, when I see feds
No foreplay, I fit that like three Zs
I'm new school, no new wave
Real bad, not sweet like toothache
My boys want an old love that I have Lebanese ting come and grab man in the new shape
Can't step on my Air Ones, are you dumb? Light man up like soufflé
All my babes all like touché
Gave her dick and that bright red bouquet
I get dark like true say
Flip things in my niz, get smash for the rude face
I'll mash your girl first something like Sunday, then Zuu, you can be third like TuesdayYou might also likeEmbed"

Looked good out of their dress but didn't impress
Some of them girls love cigarettes (-rettes)
Outside of the box tryna lose stress (Lose stress)
Love thick thighs, I'm a fan of the breasts (Fan of the breasts)
OCD, I couldn't handle the mess
If your crib's on Kings Road, but I see socks from the intro
Then I gotta plan for the next (Next)
Some girls hated on my council address
'Til I spun their world, like my hands on the decks
Pretty and Russian, tryna have the coldest discussion
And they love a hand on their necks (Facts)
Asian girl, kawaii
Set good and she love her anime like me (Like me)

If I ain't your man, I don't want no hickey

Been like that for months, I might roll a blunt
And hit that shit once 'cause a nigga been sober (Goddamn)

For every last person I loved who folded (I know)

I would take breaks, but I'd rather move forward (I won't)

Fuck what you showed me if you came up missing

The thing about yours, they never consistent
I done got paid more than I paid attention
I done felt pain more than I like to mention
Heart on my sleeve 'til it's left on the curb
When I smoke this herb I can't make good decisions
You niggas be bitches, you bitches be hoes
You switching up more than you switch your clothes
I push that work 'til I get it in gold
And light up that heat when the nights get too cold

And my thoughts got rude as you talked and chewed
On the last of your pick and mix
Said, ""You're mistaken if you're thinking
That I haven't been called cold before""
As you bit into your strawberry lace
And then offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper
It's all you had left and it was going to waste

And twisted and deranged
And I love that little game you had called Crying Lightning
And how you'd like to aggravate the ice-cream man

The next time that I caught my own reflection
It was on its way to meet you
Thinking of excuses to postpone
You never looked like yourself from the side
But your profile could not hide
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne
With folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache
Stood and puffed your chest out like you'd never lost a war
And though I tried so not to suffer the indignity of reaction

Drain me, never not maybe

And I know Sadie
Her she's a cool young lady
Back to the way I live daily
Had bare dough but that didn't change me
Plus I got a daughter
Newborn child but her name ain't Amy
L ain't got a Winnie the Pooh scarf
As of yet but I'm getting one
So stay away from me
I'll spray three eighths and I'm not even crazy
Not even lately
Feel so calm so you can't iratе me

I done the dance more than your whole gang could
I swing through man just like Flowdan would
I ain't from Brentwood, I come from Danwood
I'm straight from man a bad man wood
Stand in flames you could not
'cause you ain't from Danwood
Your whole plan would flop
If you come across me and got lairy, standard
Most of you MCs are just angered
Wiley's raw talent ain't ever been pampered
Scrimp and scrape, standard I did what Javan did

Come through like Smokey and the Bandits
But one bandit can't stand it

See, I really been out on a mission to keep all this paper, we having, still come in and flip it
Started out robbin', Batman with the gidgets
When that shit didn't work, talk to Pop 'bout the chicken
All of them talks, my badass still ain't listen
Was living, but taught me the ways of that kitchen
Don't need me a product, I can microwave, whip it
I bang the Hi-C just like a Christian
Went from that set to the spot, now we living
Still running they mouth, they gon' die 'bout them mentions
They bitches and most of 'em not from the trenches
Come to my block, come and see how we livin'
We chillin' with Glocks and they all got extensions
Moved to the North 'cause I seen they was with me
Go ask about X, got a spot, had it spinnin'
Ayy, went from ballin' to clutchin' to sinning
Was robbin', he don't give it up, then we kill him
One legged partner, 5K, he a killer
Came back from the dead, bitch, I'm feeling like Thriller
Ayy, ask your ho, bitch, she know I'm that nigga
She came through the circle, just know she a spinner
She swallow it all for a pill and some liquor
Havin' our way, could retire a stripper
But instead bought a BBL, got the bitch thicker
A fuck nigga play, he gettin' found in the river
Her diamonds froze, they so cold, made me shiver
I been pouring up drank, know it's hurtin' my liver
Shit, that's the cost to keep sane from these niggas

Haha
Against the canvas of the night
Appears a curious celestial phenomenon, called Black Star
But what is it?
Black people — unite, and let's all get down
We got to have what? We got to have that love

[Verse 1: Mos Def, Talib Kweli & Both]
What is the Black Star?
Is it the cat with the black shades, the black car?
Is it shinin' from very far to where you are?
It is commonplace and different
Intimate and distant, fresher than an infant
Black! My family thick like that-strap molasses
Star! On the rise in the eyes of the masses
Black is the color of my true love's hair
Stars are bright, shinin' and hot balls of air
Black like my baby girl's stare
Black like the veil that the Muslimina wear
Black like the planet that they fear — why they scared?
Black like the slave ship belly that brought us here
Black like the cheeks that are roadways for tears (Mmm)
That leave black faces well traveled with years
Black like assassin cross-hairs
Blacker than my granddaddy armchair
He never really got no time to chill there
'Cause his life was warfare, warfare
See, on the front lines, the Blacks is all there
Black like the perception of who on welfare
Black like faces at the bottom of the well
I've been there before
To bring the light and heat it up like la cocina
Make without imagine happen, but maybe I'm just a dreamer
I love rockin' tracks like John Coltrane love Naima
Like the student love the teacher, like the prophet love Khadija
Like I love my baby' features, like the Creator love all creatures!
Who are knowledge, truth and peace seekers
We on point like heat-seekers
Targetin' the black marketin' strategists
Run up on 'em with the heaters
Everybody followin' with no leaders
Feelin' like we killin' ourselves because I know they can't defeat us
It don't stop 'til we complete this, keep this fly
There's so much to life when you just stay Black and die
Blacker than the nighttime sky of Bed-Stuy in July
Blacker than the seed in the blackberry pie
Blacker than the middle of my eye
Black like Fela Man Cry
Some man wan' ask, ""Who am I?""
I simply reply, ""The U-N-I-V-E-R-S-A-L Magnetic!""
Work to respect the angelic (Ugh!)
Climb the mountain top and tell it 'til the valley's enveloped
You're full of big chat, but ya nah know me
I'm dark like the side of the moon you don't see
When the moon shine newly

Sometimes you show your ass like
Lint on your clothes when you froze in the black light!
Dead that! Before you get your head wrapped like Badu
We see through your voodoo
Just like Eve's Bayou, you dealin' with that black magic
Try to civilize you! Not walk on by you
Like Sybil lies do, get you blacklisted
It'll be unlucky for you like a black cat, a panther
Revolution is the answer — that's what we need
Greed plague my people like the cancer — true, indeed
[Hook: Mos Def, Talib Kweli & Both]
Now, Black people — unite, and let's all get down
Now, everybody hop on the one, the sounds of the two
It's the third-eye vision, five-side dimension
The 8th light is gon' shine bright tonight (Uh, uh, uh)
Everybody hop on the one, the sounds of the two

Black Star,Thieves In The Night,"117 ContributorsThieves in the Night Lyrics[Intro: Talib Kweli & Mos Def]
Yo D, what? Come on, yeah
What? What? Come on, yeah

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli & Both]
""Give me the fortune, keep the fame"" said my man Louis, I
Agreed, know what he mean because we live the truest lie
I asked him why we follow the law of the bluest eye
He looked at me, thought about it, was like, ""I'm clueless, why?""
The question was rhetorical, the answer is horrible
Our morals are out of place and got our lives full of sorrow
And so, tomorrow comin' later than usual
Waitin' on someone to pity us
While we find the beauty in the hideous
They say money's the root of all evil, but I can't tell
You know what I mean? Pesos, francs, yens, cowrie shells
Dollar bills, or is it the mind-state that's ill?
Creatin' crime rates to fill the new prisons they build
Over money and religion, there's more blood to spill
The wounds of slaves in cotton fields that never heal
What's the deal?
A lot of cats who buy records are straight broke
But my language universal, they be recitin' my quotes
While R&B singers hit bad notes, we rock the boat of thought
That my man Louis' statements just provoked
Caught up in conversations of our personal worth
Brought up through endangered species status on the planet Earth
Survival tactics means bustin' gats to prove you hard
Your firearms are too short to box with God
Without faith, all of that is illusionary
Raise my son — no vindication of manhood necessary

Not strong, only aggressive
Not free, we only licensed
Not compassionate, only polite
Not who the nicest
Not good, but well behaved
Chasin' after death so we can call ourselves brave?
Still livin' like mental slaves
Hidin' like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis makin' you look twice
Hidin' like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis makin' you look twice

[Verse 2: Mos Def & Both]
Yo, I'm sure that everybody out listenin' agree
That everythin' you see ain't really how it be
A lot of jokers out runnin' in place, chasin' the style
Be a lot goin' on beneath the empty smile
Most cats in my area be lovin' the hysteria
Synthesized surface conceals the interior
America — land of opportunity
Mirages and camouflages more than usually
Speakin' loudly, sayin' nothin', you confusin' me, you losin' me
Your game is twisted, want me enlisted in your usury
Foolishly, most men join the ranks cluelessly
Buffoonishly accept the deception, believe the perception
Reflection rarely seen across the surface of the looking glass
Walkin' the street, wonderin' who they be lookin' past
Lookin' gassed with them imported designer shades on
Stars shine bright, but the light rarely stays on
Same song — just remixed, different arrangement
Put you on a yacht, but they won't call it the slave ship
Strangeness, you don't control us, you barely hold this
Screamin' ""Brand new!"", when they just sanitized the old shit
Suppose it's just another clever Jedi mind trick
That they been runnin' across stars through all the time with
I find it's distressin', there's never no in-between
We either niggas or Kings, we either bitches or Queens
The deadly ritual seems immersed in the perverse
Full of short attention spans, short tempers and short skirts
Long barrel automatics released in short bursts
The length of black life is treated with short worth
Get yours first, them other niggas secondary
That type of illin' that be fillin' up the cemetery
This life is temporary, but the soul is eternal
Separate the real from the lie — let me learn you
Not strong, only aggressive 'cause the power ain't directed
That's why we are subjected to the will of the oppressive
Not free — we only licensed, not live — we just excitin'
'Cause the captors own the masters to what we writin'
Not compassionate, only polite — we well trained
Our sincerity's rehearsed in stage, it's just a game
Not good, but well behaved, 'cause the cameras survey
Most of the things that we think, do or say
We chasin' after death just to call ourselves brave
But everyday, next man meet with the grave
I give a damn if any fan recall my legacy
I'm tryin' to live life in the sight of God's memory
Like that, y'all
[Interlude: Mos Def & Talib Kweli]
A lot of people don't understand the true criterion of things
Can't just accept the appearance, have to get the true essence
They ain't lookin' around
[Chorus: Talib Kweli, Mos Def, & Both]
Not strong, only aggressive
Not free, we only licensed
Not compassionate, only polite
Not who the nicest
Not good, but well behaved
Chasin' after death so we can call ourselves brave
Still livin' like mental slaves
Hidin' like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis makin' you look twice
Hidin' like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis makin' you look twice
Hidin' like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis makin' you look twice
Hidin' like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis makin' you look twice

I've never known happiness
I've never known what sweet caress is (Never know what sweet caress is)
Still, I'll be always laughing like a clown
Won't someone help me ?
Cause I (Sweet life, has got to be)
I've got to pick myself from off the ground

He sits around inside his house
From room to room, he moves about
Fills his life with pointless things
And wonders how it all turns out

Don't waste it

Afraid of what the truth might bring
He locks his doors and never leaves
Desperately searching for signs
Too terrified to find a thing
He battens all the hatches down
And wonders why he hears no sounds
Frantically searching his dreams
He wonders what it's all about

The mirage of Del Rio
It was burnin' in his eyes
And sleep had escaped him
Too consumed by his pride
Like the lonesome and high country
He was lost in a haze
And the thoughts of what he'd do
If he unloaded all his rage
The man from Waco

[Verse 2]
The city was almost silent
As he passed the hummin' signs
On the corner, he heard laughter
Made him afraid of what he'd find
He pushed through the door
Hypnotized by a sound
Just then, tears overcame him
And his heart began to drown
The man from Waco

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It was there that he shot her
While the lovers were embraced
With the bullet he intended
For the man who took his place
He cried through the night
As he made his escape
But the rain that was fallin'
Could not wash away his shame

Les litispendants, dit-il, congsistes et donauds, rois des arans et les dalkeys, rois de boue et de tory, même le roi dieu bouc de Killorglin, furent aiguillonnés par leurs supporteurs sous la forme de femmes bettières à la chevelure tendue à l’arc d'une rougeur Carrothagénuine, agitant des pettises cramoisies et criant du haut de la tour d'Isod. Il y eut des cris sortant des trapus dans le prétoire et des macdublines sur le naquielletré de : aie tête au bang de Banagher, Mick, sieur ! Prodouise O'Donnier. Aa! Exhibez ses reliques! Bu!

Ainsi te voici maintenant là ils étaient, quand tout s'achevait encore, les quatre, assis sur l'autour dans leur chambres de juges, dans la salle de muniment, de toute leur marshalsée, sous les suspices de Laly, autour de leurs vieilles traditionnelles tables de la loi comme Tandefous des Solans bassant le temps à en reparler retoujoursencorpareil. Bien secrément et sec y est. La lwa souffrant du dring. Selon courtise des évelynes du roi. Que dieu la chèvre et qu'elle kiss le bouc Un. Festives et javasaintes et enjouéjon et sa bette rosse bibette dorlotte et qu’eut n’oublivraie ici a'duna o'darnel. Eux quatre et grâce à la cour maintenant il n'y avait plus d'eux. Alors passe poussée pour l'amour du port. Rincé soit-il. Ah ho ! Et te souviens-tu, Chointebide à parâtre, le marrant même, le grand Commonlesapel, et son vieux surnom, Crade Papa les Pantaloufs,  dans ses monopoleums, derrière la guerre des deux roses, avec Michel Victoire, le pristre des simères,

C'était quand j'étais dans mon père pètre à l'ouest et elle et moi-même, la fille aux cheveux rouges, poignant maître la nuit descendant le Layon du Sycomore. Joli jeu des sens on en a eu mid les kissembettes primeroyant dans la coulante quénombre courcre de la luxuriyance. Mon parfum des pampas, dit elle (voulant dire moi) sortant ses néderlueurs, et j'aurais plus vite eu une gorgée précieuse de ta rosée pure de montagne que d'enrichir mon accointance avec le rot de ce gros brasseur.
Et ainsi continuèrent-ils, les hommes de la quatre boutelles, les analistes, unguam et nunguam et lunguam encor, leur anschluss à propos d'qui c'est avant elle et d'après où il est et comment elle a été perdue loin loin dans la fougère et comment il a été fondé des funds du profond près d’une oreille, et les bruissements et les gazouillements et les râpements et les claquements et les suspirements et les paintèlements et les ukukuinements et les (hist !) les bondissements à sépart et les (hast !) les babailles à déguerpissements et les monclins au scandale et les purs craigs qu’il y a us (hop) en ce temps-là de vivre et mollir et élire et courir autour du Square Ventre de Nonne.

De son taillis exratisé à croivers les landes corssées géniales au mois de Yuliel de la Chasse des Homfrits de Mullinahob et de Ville Paon, puis le portant direct sur Ville Chope, l'excentrice, un blanc noulan que les bassets rabatteurs de M.Loewensteil Fitz Urse avaient d'abord mal blairé comme une bistrarre bruine, les aboyeurs menaient le train, puis à travers Ville Rays, et Ville Horloque, et loopant le loupe, à Ville Chope encore. Eoreille la coquine hase en doublant Ville de Chivre ils l'ont coursé, à travers Ville Louveline et Ville Noix pour l’enrouler de vent les Boulées. Mais du bon tour quand il fut à la fin enfui, vise, sur La Butte Rut en manteau de plein hiver avec des coussinets à palpitant, pointant sa maison d'erromance son vieux nordest dans ses hessiens cylindroyaux un volponisme de fuchser sourd le cacha tout près à couvert, miraculeusement nourri par les corbeaux et mis en bouée, en rumière, réticule, onasum et abomasum, sur (Que Toutbrasseham l'hydre au miel !) la sherriesse crèmefraichée d'un syllabub à la cannelle, Mikkleravi, Nikklesuffi.

Le nazard ou l'apaisard l'avait rendit blem, blem, stoné blem. Etincelles fluiantes. Il havait fui encore (shunshem ouvre-toi !) cette contrée d'exil, fait sa mue, insidèle à sha m'aison via le subterranéen étayé de bois de lits, parti clandestinement et ankeré dans un fût de fonds de cale hollandais, le Cul d'Ars, hotte S.S. Finlandia, et occupait même maintenant, sous un nouveau nhome islamitique de la septième génération, un corps physique de Cornelius Magrath (salvieux karakter, drwawcommun bondaboite) en Asie Majeure, où comme Turc du théâtre (la clef toute plattée, le roi, onze pétantes) il avait piastré les buikdanseuses de l'opulence de son omnibox tandis qu'aussi arabe à la porte de la rue, il pestait les pachauissiers pour les aumônes d'un dinier. Fils qui bourdonnent. L'étonnement paisiblement général assisté par la regrettitude avait mis un terme jusqu'à son existence: il vit le sagard de famille, démissiogné, se démonter les restes, rappelé et jetéaudétritué par le Faiseur. Gazouillis de travers. Un aïelement privé infûme (vulgovariovénérien) havait clamé en droit ultime,  clos son cercle vicieux, d'un claquement. Brouillage confit. Il avait marché vers le milieu d'une mare à nunuphars quand il s'était inébrié au point que ses chemises à bretelles rejoignaient ses cnicrebocres, comme le poisswang m’arine les eaux bouillonnantes, où les mains primaidantes des percheurs avaient rescapé un de très possiblement plusieurs sentimètres d'eau demi friche. Bouillie tartinée. Rue de l'Ombrelle où il avait bien boit d'une pompesse un ouvrier genre til, M. Blancmèché, lui donna une pièce de bois. Quels mots de pouvoir furent faits fas entre eux, ekenymes et auchnomes, acnomina ecnumina ?

Mais la ruine seulante de la pluie a entendu. Estout pourporteral ! Les crépitements torticoulèrent. Un pestil humain bicyclant (piste !) et recyclant (past !) dans les rues lugées, l'y revoilà (pouste !). L'amorse nuisance fit noise. Il avait largement du jeu et (Oh chérie !) pouvait être n'importe où quand une ex-nonne déguisée, d'un statructure énorme et de manières masculines la quarantaine assez grasse, Carpulenta Gygasta, hattira l'hattention par une conduite harbitraire avec un homnibus. Les antennes buzzèrent aux auditeurs côtiers d'une escarcelle de percepteur de surtaxe freur, pleinement grosses, sporrane, cravate, aigrette, tabard et maudit manteau anti coup de froid, la marque de son tailleur (Chez le Père Baerne) se lisant V.P.H., s'est trouvé auprès du Trou du Frar Scalde, et plus d'un longeur tressaillait à penser quelle espaice de beste, loups, de croppis ou fraère de quatre sous, l'avait dévoré. C.W. cheté wamplement. Hvidfinns lyk, drohneth svertgleam, Valkir lockt. Sur son posterne de rose sieur, comme disaient les garçons, au week-end de la Pentecôte avait été cloué un nom encré et un titre, inscrit dans les cursives nationales, accéléré, régressif, filiforme, tourellé et enveninoloppé dans la piggotrie.

She don't want me with nobody else (No one еlse)
She just want me all to hеrself (All to herself)
She don't share with nobody else (Keep goin')

Make her feel like a superstar, she way above average

Then do it yourself, king

Yeah, I just came to the area I grew up in
And they can't even see the car, but from the engine, they know it's me
From no fixed abode to the coast of Greece
I'm most at home in the places I ain't supposed to be
I grew up seeing mummy count pennies
Tryna buy a train ticket, but forget sayin', ""Woe is me""
Now I'm in L.A. with the open sea
They both feel like things I wasn't supposed to see
Used to be my pulse, we was close
Now we argue to the rhythm of a broken beat
To the beat of a broken heart
Napoleon Bonaparte meets Joan of Arc, shh
We're both fightin' the sea, this is Noah's ark
Where lovers with a broken past, grow apart
Most things that last have the slowest start
A lotta pain and a lotta tears
The only reason that I lie is 'cause of what I fear
My girl knows that I'm a fan of charity
But there's some information I ain't ever gonna volunteer
I wish that I could pay for my sins with a lump sum
Restore her belief in me with a trust fund
The money can't buy nothing when the love's done
I used to cheat with Americans for a living
I felt nervous every time I got a call from a plus one
It takes years to build when you love one
Two and half minutes and it's undone
Bought my girl a Birkin and she told me that these bitches can't chat to her, I'm tellin' her that they never could
You know you love her when you're doin' shit you never would
Come up off the drugs and bank scams
How the fuck you think I got the name Santan?
Run up on me and get a skin tan
Only when you're gone, they feel your impact
Nineteen, I had dreams of a wedding ring
So focused on running our race
You can ask James Blake, I ain't see the colour in anything
And then the world got darker than it's ever been
Real estate, I buss a smile

Mortgage on the yard like twenty-two hundred
But the rent's got it covered by a country mile

With the highest rates of violence taking place
In somе of the poorest boroughs""

[Verse]
Look, I bet thеm boys think I'm panickin'
Check what my young Gs are carryin'
His blade same length as a javelin
I don't know about B-ball or what's happenin'
But know that it's fucked if he's travellin' and we see him
I can't lie, I was depressed at phases
I was nineteen when the team nearly left him faceless
Hopin' that we never left no traces
You know when you're so damn tired in your house
But you can't sleep cah you got pendin' cases
I used to love temptin' fate, but now it's temptin' faces
For half my career, I was part of that
My best friend got a burner, and it's lookin' like a artifact
Put it in your puffer or your Prada hat
Like fuck panic, that's a heart attack
Yeah, it's like, life's so fucked in the time that we're in
We're fightin' the world, and we're fightin' within
Somali dad ran away from a war
Now his son's in a war, that's the cycle we're in
I know niggas that didn't do time in a bin
That have never had freedom of mind, are you sick?
'Round here, main way to provide for your kin
Is in a flick blade, little push-bike and a sim
In London, a place where it's nicer to live
Is only five minutes out from the guys on the strip
Where man make yay' work, heard he a soldier
I know that nigga hasn't got balls like Grey Worm
As I grow older, change of perspective
I gotta stay loyal to my girl, that's the trait she was blessed with
Restaurants, raves with my bredrins
Life's too short, so we gotta turn up
Man talk on my ting for the 'Gram, it's intrusive
I never really thought 'bout taking a life
Till I found out my ex-girl's dad is abusive
I felt, ""How could I be a man and not do shit?""
I'm on the way there now, and I don't wanna lose it
But fightin' her battle's only hurtin' the girl
How can I protect her from the world
When I couldn't even protect her from myself?
On my grandmother's grave, shit happens again
I put a knife through a family friend
Most the women that I know had shit happen to them
So innocent till guilty, ain't somethin' that I have to respect
I think back to my youth, and I was so ungrateful
How many of our parents had dreams they abandoned
So they could put food on the table?
Intelligent, worthy, and able, that's somebody's parent
You know?
And that affected the way that I see shit
Nightclub toilet, you peed on the seat
'Cause you don't know how it feels when your mum's gotta clean shit
And her boss treats her like she don't even mean shit
And she gotta wait for the bus in the rain, and it's freezin'
And Miss said that you won't ever be shit
And you don't wanna cry about dad, but you need him
I grew up so fucked, but I didn't even deep it
I'm numb to the feelin' of grievin'
And man gettin' birded
African mums on the floor, just screamin'
It's mad cah I try so hard
Death's got to be easy, cah life's so hard
I was twelve wishin' that I was a white man, hard
Cah if I was then they probably wouldn't life man's dargs
I was dead broke, fam, I couldn't swipe mans card
And time might pass, but I still gotta stay with it
It wasn't his beef, but I see him try claimin' it
That's why he caught a bullet with another man's name on it
Now he can't do leg day or put strain on it
Every time you hear me freestyle, I put pain in it
I used to wonder, ""Does God have favourites?""
Touch me, it's dangerous, I wouldn't play with it
'Cause you can go sleep, and have a different type of wake for it
I miss my dawgs
Unstable, you violate Chris? Then rah
Turn Chris Benoit
Have him hit from far, nah
Fill 'em up with bricks and glass, nah
My young Gs will grip, then blast
Have you tried in the street
Fuck findin' my feet
I could ride, but it's better when I'm ridin' a beat
My emotions are peak, it ain't a sign of defeat or the weak
I would **** you, then cried in my sleep
Dropped Juss two racks and told him, ""Buy the machine""
I'm LeBron in Miami, I provide for the heat
God strike me if I'm lyin', I ain't cryin' in this beef
Unless the tear's comin' tatted on the side of my cheek
I provide for my peeps, the Lamb' white in the seats
So I'm literally a wolf disguised in a sheep
You have five-figure dreams, I have five-figure sleep
Five hours more than enough time that I need
Man want a fair fight, but I ain't on it when we see him
Fuck honour, this revolver is onomatopoeic
Let it stut-tut-tut-tut-tut-tut-tutter when you see him
Free Scalez, Free C and free my niggas till I see 'em
I wouldn't wanna be 'em
My OG's roamin', I don't need a colosseum
You see it?
So I'm playin' it good, let hood politics stay in the hood
Fuck the internet, you see this new generation
They're Insta'-beefin' and I ain't into speakin'
When I ducked down
I had him runnin' in a lift like he missed a meetin'
There's no good reason to risk your freedom
The yutes dem snitch and them bitches sneakin'
She don't wanna talk 'bout friendship
She just wanna deal with the pipe like I'm fixin' leakin'
And sleep with a legend like Chrissy Teigen
Where I'm from, the word ""Life"" has a different meanin'
Man smile in your face, but them niggas schemin'
Try involve me in a flakey dealin'
Sistine Chapel, I'ma paint the ceilin'
I been violated and I hate the feelin'
That's why nowadays, man hates the preachin'
We smile in the visit, cah we ain't defeated
The Supreme Court's where my mates appealin'
I can't breed that girl, that's torture
South London, it's just slags on the corner
And influencers tryna bag them a baller
She a gold digger, I can tell from her aura
Her socials say princess, she a pauper
When it's time for it, need more for my daughter
Call me a talker, but man are gettin' lined like lambs in the slaughter
It's life-threatenin' and I can tell from the borer
Cut through a nigga like a knife through flora
Feds got the guys on a case and they stalk us
It's a conspiracy, like tinfoil hats and a new world order
Touch me, you better have a life insurer
Bloodthirsty, I got sharks in the water
And trust me, I know a killer well, no orca
Have you ever seen a nightmare brought to life?
Where I'm from, you get cheffed on a normal night
Man talk on my name, but it's porky pies
I'll really put it in a prick like a porcupine
Little bro wanna save for a .45
Go board a flight, there's more to life
Yutes on the M6 all the time
We don't need TFL for a northern line
All the best politicians been taught to lie
Where do they buy cocaine when they're snortin' white?
Are their dealers safe or on the borderline?
It's ironic, cah we don't know where to draw the line
Man see Blue Story, they're mortified
Man see Scarface and it's glorified
'Cause when you're Black, everything gets scrutinised
That's why they call it ""Urban"", it gets euphemised
South London, man are gettin' euthanised
I see a yute's demise, I wasn't too surprised
He got soaked, but his right hand scuba dived
Don't die by a sword that you used to shine
You can drown for your king, you don't know about Ophelia
Cah we got iron, I don't know about anaemia
I took the hard road, we don't know about the easier
One bag of whores and drug paraphernalia
When ends got sticky, had a flicky with Emelia, I mean Olivia
This ain't Libya, this ain't Syria
You act sillier, we let it seep in your skin like Nivea
Who wants to be a millionaire? I won it
Never done a gameshow or trivia
I done Wandsworth, Erlestoke visitor
I done Springhill, Grendon, Swinfen, Whitemoor, Swaleside, Brixton visitor
I done M-way trips, done shit that I wish I never did
Becah I could have been a prisoner
Is this the shit that appeals to the listeners?
Road ain't no amazin' life
The ends full of snakes and jail's just a waste of time
I tell my young Gs, ""Take your time""
Fuck Jazz, you could really see a major nine
Yo, I'm so ashamed of how I used to get figures
Man sell you a dream like the road ting's lit
And then they leave out the parts where you're buryin' your niggas
Or in jail, wonderin' who's puttin' dick inside your Misses
I'm so fuckin' determined
I was in intensive care when I was born, mummy fell down the stairs
Whether I was gonna live or not was somethin' uncertain
I used the word ""Fell,"" with the commas inverted
You see, growin' up I had it far from perfect
But nobody did, so I'm a normal person
I gotta be grateful, we all have demons, and all see angels
Or maybe it's me
A Black yute's more than a face on a screen
A number on a laptop or name on a sheet
We got stories to tell and got places to be
From my heart, that's the makin' of me

I was selling, look, I was selling tomatoes

I struggled 'cause I didn't want to suffer again
**** I just wanted, he'd just make me so upset
Three times I tried to come here
I went to Hannover, they sent me back
I tried so much, he has not seen anything yet
I was in detention camps for months and years, I didn't give up
I was not even twenty when I left Africa
I was determined to survive
I was determined to succeed
I didn't know anybody, nobody was ready to help me
Even when you were born
You were six weeks old, this one is not even Africa, it's this nation
I was on the streets for three years
I have three babies in my hand
Nobody let me in, nobody in this nation
I couldn't pay my rent, deported gangsters carried—
I didn't give up, I carried my babies everywhere
And now this is how **** pay me back for all those pain that I go through
Every day I lay in my bed, I'm in pain
You see what he's doing to me

Any weapon formed against me can't prosper, imposter, I'ma fill 'em with lead
My best friend like Tommy Lee Sparta, I'm in the Gaza just tryna get bread
The Chinese wanna tek way Naija, most of my people, they struggle and stress
Political corruption, I rise up until there ain't a government left
Cost to be the boss, even though I'm financed, the man couldn't afford it
Fifteen, mummy found my shank, and I nearly got shipped, I was gonna do boardin'
I had a one lightie from Pecks and a ten-ten Yoruba babe from Shoreditch
If you got a body like Uche, text me and I'ma pay your father's mortgage
Listen, I'ma pay your uncle's rent
And if rap don't pay, then we would've been getting it off of crack cocaine
I don't know how man could chat so brave
Little nigga, you ain't bad, no way
I think me, women and Italian shoes
Work well together like Maggi and cube
Pretty in pink, but she badder in blue
If you were me, you'd be arrogant too

Looking for one wish, on a Ray J ting

But she can't see ’cause I got shades and ting
Bare girls wanna throw shade and ting
No shade, what shade is your foundation in?

To an ’18 plate, man's parking a Benz
Far from the rest but I’m far from my best
Life is a lesson, I'm passing a test
Yes, everyting blessed
I don't want drama and I don't want stress
My girl got finesse, Caribbean flex
Body and chest, take buddy in chest
Thank God more, I grew up with less

Love is conditional
Love could go missin' on you (Look)

[Verse 1: Central Cee]
We elevated, we don't have to trap harder
Now my back garden same size as Battersea Park
I ain't puttin' no suit and tie on, I turned down the Met Gala
Mum kicked me out, to be fair, I was beefin' my step father
I put her on first class, would've thought I was Jack Harlow
Look, I was eatin' beans out the tin, now it's avocado
I'm in Cape Town, roof down, playin' Amapiano
Dave got nine in the Sprinter, I'm tryna pack the Viano
I park wherevеr I want, like fuck a ticket inspector
I'm your typical rappеr, fuckin' bitches my pleasure
Money, hoes and the clothes, I got plenty kicks in my dresser
My akhs still in the trap on the 25th of December
That girl is a ho, but I won't judge, 'cause I'm a slag as well
Spend a couple bills on Aperol Spritz up in Bagatelle
Put food on the scale and hit the strip if the rappin' fails
I was OT, I was bashin' over Brazzers
Think I'm bougie, I ain't pressin' girls in Fashion Nova dresses
Arguin' my ex, goin' back and forth over texts
Baby, I won't lie, if you're mine, I'm over-possesive
Broke, smokin' until the roach, I was stressin'
Collect my tears, you could fill a pool and breaststroke in it
I started gettin' used to the mice, I just stepped over them
At the BFA, I knew they'd hate the dress code I'm in
Two kilogram chain and it's makin' my neck swole a bit
My youngin got caught with the crack, he's tapped 'cause he swallowed it
Keep the shoes intact, had to give 'em back 'cause I borrowed them
Made it out the hood, I might go enroll to a college
And get a uni degree, just to show my mum that I'm sorry
For all the times she was settin' them rules I never obeyed, uh
New crib come with a chef and a maid
Get hit at a close range, that's if you're over the gate
Retire now, be rich the rest of my days

Elevation, forever patient
I've been on my Seven Nation Army ting, Ferrari with the white stripes
No lullabies inna my life
This turbulence rock a nigga to sleep in my night flights
My life's like I'm doin' the most
But I still feel like I ain't doin' enough, I don't know who I can trust
If I'm buyin' Chanel bags for these women that I don't like
Then just imagine what I'm doin' for the woman I love
Red cheeks whenever I'm with strippers, that shit just look like a clown face
I tell a nigga cut to the clout chase
Bein' broke, I can feel that, mummy had to squeeze into the flats
Like she was borrowin' some shoes and her heels snapped
I gotta put dollars on pages
No religion in the trap, it's Creed III
Feel like I'm Jonathan Majors
Before I got it on stages, I got it in stages
I'm Ivan Toney the way they watchin' my wagers
You fat fucker, made five K, it's just me and my black cutter
These chains two kilos, should be workin' with black butter
Festivals, I'm makin' five mill' on a bad summer
My summer's are good, never mind
Women doin' CRB checks on a search engine, I can't catch no breaks
So many ways to die, you think we're goin' off old age?
I ain't goin' off a women addiction
I got body dysmorphia, a figure addiction, uh
Our bread different, don't lie on my name
My tax seven-eight-seven like I'm flyin' a nigga
Don't even worry, I done dropped tears
Took a loss, had to drop tiers, made it all back and hit the top tier
For eight years, Good Mornin' Britain, I had to change peers
Rocky Balboa, different fights and the same stares
Cars like drinks, don't leave them unattended in Mayfair
For times I couldn't cover the train fare
It's Oysters, the Oyster Perpetual, the women incredible
The work's seminal, had to change my number on the low, I'm too accessible
Hah, I could've fucked a flight attendant but she just too professional
Are you a virgin, or you work for them?
A lot of niggas chase clout, but I guess it's what works for them
We're twenty-five, livin' like this was our second life
I see the pressure rise, everybody lookin' to us when it's time to get it right
And we can't even get to write
It's time I get a life, it's time I get a wife
Shot caller, robbed niggas and ended up in hot water
But you take what you can get when it was cold showers, no powers
Had to give myself my own flowers
Sittin' at the top and niggas so sour
You know? (Yeah)

And I'm in the zone too like Karma

I've got a brown-skin girl from Bush
That will take that charge on the chest if I say so
Both hands on her wig while I hit from the back
Got me pullin' on her tracks and cane rows
Two man in a Superdry jacket and new Astra
Man, it's lookin' like plain clothes
We ain't never had halos
Just Henny and Jenny from the block, no J.Lo
This year here is gonna be a mad one
I need a good girl, I need a bad one

Quickly stop off at the off-licence
Bossman, let me get a two-two drink
Gyaldem ah watch my ting (Ah)
How 'bout a crook and a princess combinin'
And I've been givin' gyal the good pipe
And man walked in, yo, it's not what it looks like
Give man high five, kiss her goodnight
I'm in your eyesight
But I'm not your type, I'm more like lowlife
Keep quiet, I'm preaching
Put a sock in it, put a sock on the fire alarm
Fingers lookin' like a firearm
Well I spit this fire
Plus I came with the fire
Um, what's that ting with the silencer?
Man come through and silence 'em
I was never the cool kid
More like strange and awkward
Biscuit for your forehead
Till my forearm's exhausted

Spent four months in the forefront

You can get stuck in the mud
We sent your man to the shop
What do you mean? He ain't ever made it rain
Your man is a fraud, your boyfriend's livin' a lie
You're kinda like Rachel Zane
I'm gentle when it comes to the girl dem
But I'm gangster with some voddy and voss
My girl don't wanna stop for a chat
Then I'm onto her friends like Joey and Ross
Babe, what you mean you can't talk for a sec?
It's calm, you don't even know what you lost
Stone Island from my head to my feet
When I step on the street, I dunno what it cost, but
I know it's expensive
She told me she love me, but really I don't even know if she meant it
And if feds pull this whip, that's numerous offences
Why you gassed off a rack?
I put three on my dentist, I put three on my dentist

And I want you now with me
And I want you now with me
And I

[Verse]
I made a link with the Russians
Six figure discussions, dinners in public
My linen all tailored
My outstanding payments swift like Taylor
And boy, I owe 'dem man a beatin'
But don't watch what I'm makin'
Just know I put both of the P's in opp
At the same time, I put the ""pay"" in paigon
Man wanna beef, don't know what the stakes is
Broad daylight, do a nigga on a day shift
Free Scales, got him livin' on basic
My location changes quicker than gears on a brand new Porsche Cayman
I told RJ put down the line and he did
But he's got another three like H's
I gotta watch for the greed and the hatred
I'm sayin' who's on votes?
We hit up a nigga and see who's on smoke when it's that time
You can run that shit there and it's cool but you can't hear like a bad line
It's been fifteen minutes since me and her fucked and I'm sayin', ""What you still in the house for?""
Girls say I'm rude but they won't never leave, 'cause you know the jab right like southpaws
Outdoors, me and my niggas are all outlaws
I tell a man speak with respect
How you gonna say that we beef with your chest
Like Sergei didn't G-lean on your set?
I do not have one neek as a friend
If it's beef on the ends than it's peaker for them
This ting's comin' like Pokémon Go
'Cause I see man once, never seen him again
Man don't really wanna walk to the shop
Or jump in the train 'cah the ends got tension
One eye on my opps, two eyes on my friends
'Cause at least with my opps, man knows their intentions
I turned a loss to a lesson
I turned a curse to a gift and a blessing
Any girl that I've got an interest in
Face interesting, body impressive
I got ninety-nine out of a hundred marks in class on my English questions
I'd get the same if I did it again 'cause I still don't know the definition of restin'
I've put blood in, I've put sweat in
I shed tears when my niggas got sentenced
I spent years with my niggas in Streatham
But you wouldn't know that 'cause you don't live this
What have you done for your siblings?
I made sure that the family's sweet
So many days that I starved myself just to make sure that my whole family eats
The Merc is a beast and I'm blackin' it out
One point nine on the plan for a house
I ain't got a memory of when dad was around
Still a child when I turned man of the house
Tell me what you know about a bag full of bills
And your mum crying out, saying, ""Son, I can't take it""
And then staring in the mirror for an hour
With a tear in your eye like, ""I gotta go make it""
Ever seen a good friend turn paigon?
A pretty girl glow down, turn basic?
Ever seen a nigga 'nough man rated
Losing his mind 'cause of food that he's takin'?
You're either a lamb or you're Hannibal
Good kid but I grew up 'round animals
No chick can't tell me about attitude
I got a girl from the Screwface Capital

I got the alligator with the pointy shoes, feel like I come from Congo
Took a trip, Toronto, back then, I had a girl from Ajax
Saw Rick Ross in his jet on a runway, but it was me that landed to a Maybach
Ask Joney, New York don't know that I rap
I stepped to a jawn, she callin' me ""Modie,"" I ain't no hero
She want Novikov, ideally, but she good with Nobu, Robert De Niro

I see man gettin' extorted, sayin' he blessed the hood

Slimey, gain his trust, build that bridge and then burn it later
Back then, I woulda robbed my man and then helped him look for the perpe—
I woulda helped him look for the perpetrator, it's a mystery

Still on sight if I see him in Heathrow (Base), swing them hands like Kaaris
She went from the Lambo' Urus to Yaris, got picked up, but she gettin' a Uber

Drinkin' apple cider vinegar
Wearin' Skim 'cause she wanna be Kim and 'em
Uh, alright, I know that you're bad, stop actin' innocent
We ain't got generational wealth
It's only a year that I've had these millions
My whip could've been in the Tokyo Drift 'cause it's fast and furious

Came back with a fresh one, it's new
Don't come around for a two of the blue
I don't give a fuck if you're old or new
I'll just yawn like, ""Blackball, who?""
Put a couple dead MCs in the grave
Trust me, darg, you can go there too
Trust me, darg, you can go there free
I don't ever watch F-A-C-E
AJT from MTP
NikeLab tracksuit, Nike ID
Man got overly fucked in the beef
Pretty sure I landed a bang to his teeth
Man will get banged in the face by me
Not my bredrin, banged in the face by me

[Verse 5: Dave]
And me
Man talk tough, we'll see
Hit him with the left-right, left-right, left-right-right
One jab, then I duck, then weave
Come like Trevor from GTA
If I bang man's face, man bop, then lean
Kun Aguero, man dropped the shoulder feint once
Quick kick then I drop man's G
First time I link her, Nando's, sweet
£9.95, I swipe, then eat
I one-two rap, she don't give hat
Thiago Silva, man block, then skeet
Had man screaming ""Look, there's my man""
Hand in my pouch like, ""Where? It's not me""
Hand in my pouch like, ""Where? It's not us""
Turned to my G like, ""Where? It's not we""
So if you get boom with the .45 long
It's a critical hit, no chance to repeat
And if you see Arge in the cut with the dip
You're pissed so quick your team should retreat
But if you see Juss in the cut with his right hand tucked
You're fucked, your team should leave, G
If you see Rapz in the back with his hand in the bag
It's mad, we came to see Ps
[Chorus: Dave & AJ Tracey]
Walk in the rave, smile on my face
Drink in my cup, hand in my jeans
Man talk tough, man look up, down, left, right
Straight to a bang in the teeth
Man still talk tough, man saw man in the flesh
Now man's tryna talk to my Gs
Nah, none of that, none, .45 drum
Run you right out of your street
Walk in the dance, chicks wanna glance
Hand on my hip, shank for the dip
If I shout ""Oi"", them man there best skip
Better tie up your laces tight and don't trip
Trip, get splashed
Couldn't care less about my man's gang
We're not fam, we're not friends or bredrins
You'll get tanned and binned, cock, then blam

Dave,Trojan Horse,"87 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeРусскийPortuguêsDeutschTrojan Horse Lyrics[Verse 1: Dave]
I'm feelin' villainous
I couldn't afford them kicks, I had one pair, and I cleaned them rigorous
Squeeze in junior, I feel like Vinícius
Young Gs stupid, but, they ain't idiots
It's scary, trap insidious
How you expect us to know how to love? You know?
I can't teach no one how to hustle, some man just got it
Back then I got chased by feds, I ran out of breath and I wanted to vomit
I hit that freak, she put me in cuffs, it triggered my trauma, I tell her to stop it
She wanna know if I'm really ballin', that girl there wanna weigh my wallet

[Verse 2: Central Cee]
We ain't doin' irrational get backs, creep up clean when they least expect it
Hygiene's poor, look at the floor, there's insects crawlin', I could've got sepsis
Nasty, still try fuck on my step-sis (Huh)
Ran through 'nough of these famous girls,but I still got some on my checklist
Bare gunman on my guestlist
I took bro-bro out of the trenches
Jump out the Volvo, jump out the Lexus, active
He ain't got no preference, slapped it
But, when I retrospected, I could've been calm and collected
Avoided a problem and fleed the scene
Too vocal, don't need no beat
I go old-school like Evisu Jeans
Who's that with the cargos and Corteiz?
The back poke out and the waist petite
Got flown out all the way to Greece
She got great physique

2 A.M., I'm callin' Clint, like, ""Yo, who's that girl in the vest?""
I'll send a delivery text, I know that it's wrong, it is what it is
Broski locked, I'm visitin' him
Brought eaters to the prison for him
Vision for him, and it's bigger than him
Disrespect, I'm sizzlin' him
That girl look like SZA to me
How you upset that I cut you off when you basically handed the scissors to me?
Two-man step, diligently (Grrah)
Watch my back vigilantly
My young boy do man differently
She wanna show them girl she know me, call my government name
I never tucked my shirt in school, so why would I grow up and tuck my chain?
Hide my face like, ""Fuck the fame""
Trust indifferent, but love's the same

[Verse 4: Central Cee]
I don't trust anyone lately, this lifestyle sendin' me crazy
Who's to say that they'll never betray me? Rusty one from the 1980s
But the new plate, a millennium baby
She deserve a standin' ovation the way that she got on her knees and ate me
Two hands, Lord Jesus, save me
We all know the industry's fake, the streets fake as well
Stand up for my rights like Santan Dave, them man stand up like Dave Chappelle
You can lock the lock, but the trap don't stop
Half of the block get paid in jail
That was a risky text before
And, now it's no danger, I'm on a major scale
[Verse 5: Dave]
That was a risky text before, if I send that now, there ain't no danger
The way that the light bounce off of these GIAs make gyal act stranger
Got love for all of the young Gs bookin' a flight, and I'm headed to Asia
Four and a baby goin' away, times were hard, I slept in a manger
Give her the Trojan, give her the Trojan Horse, I feel like Troy
Had a revolver, decomposin' hid in the woods, I feel like Roy
She give me a whine, blood rushed to my genitals
Lucky for me, she could feel my—
Is it right? Won't say that it is
Shame that it is and it is what it is

[Verse 6: Central Cee]
Oi, Dave, I don't even wanna release (Why?)
I don't wanna be mentioned in the same sentence as none of these creeps
I don't wanna come to your session, I don't wanna jump on none of your beats
We could talk 'bout direct debit, my monthly payment a hundred Gs
Taxman on me, I keep receipts
My biggest paigons HMRC (Huh)
Bro got it in Masjid, he got a mad ting under his kameez
Bad one watchin' her calories, long ting, 'cause, I wanna go out to eat
Hella petite like Bella Hadid, so I handle it delicately, she kind of surprised I got eloquent speech

[Verse 7: Dave]
I got a ting from DC, Harley Quinn, felt like the Joker
Back then, I had my nank in Dallas, Texas hold 'em, me and my poker
Antisocial, I'm a loner
He got done up in mid-November and didn't recover 'til late October
You'll need more than sling on a shoulder
Young black Brit in Italian kit, I feel like Tammy in Roma
I had the Range with the extra seats, so I squeezed that bitch in the back of the Rover
Cliffs of Dover, white on sea
Who's that there on the C2C?
She want a man with decent P
And her ex is a factor, Misha B
Let's not talk 'bout makin' a mill', this year, I average one in a month
Had a vision of runnin' it up, and it's workin' well like rum in a punch
In DLT I ain't come for a brunch
Who's that brownin' sat in a passy
I have plans of a cash and carry, my legs were dry, my elbows ashy

Go broke and watch them all leave us
I can't give a ho my jumper, she'll go home and put it on Depop
I'm in the car with my girl and my guy called me, I'm like, ""Bro, you're on speaker""
Toxic rеlationship with my bitch
One day, we're split, now wе're goin' Antigua
Three man jump out the four-door vehicle
It's a miracle if a boy don't get touched
Don't step on our block and trespass
Gotta check in and apply for a ESTA
Young G came to the Dragons' Den
He want a nine bar and he need a investor
UberLUX with a thot inside, she ain't comin' to fuck, there's a key in the S-Class

Trap, you ain't got a rack to your name, my bro brick layin', we don't know about Shoreditch
Rental, I never insured it, M25, gotta whip that calmly
Man try beef with my dargy, Warzone ting how I come third party

I don't rock Gucci or Armani, ST from ST, I can't
Squash that beef like fruit and barley, still got a one black star like Kwame

And a one brownin' from Compton

Man pull up to the bumper and do it like Konshens

Went for the cheapest bag, that's nonsense
I took a hundred bags from Barclays bank
No cap, you can go and ask Ellie
That one mine, Bouncing Betty

Best believe that I'm back like Nelly
Chest petite with a back like jelly
I'm seein' man send indirects
If you wanna war man, then you better be vocal
My right hand got a semi, that's local
And this Brownin' I can't post on socials
My girl gotta be far from social, I don't wanna see her at Carni'
Four-double-eight in the party, LBC how I nicked the Ferrari
Girls say we're the littiest batch in South London and, bro, it's a fact
Airport, we're going for bants, I hopped out the plane, I ain't going Verdansk
What you know about telling a ten-ten to keep her clothes on and moving good?
I ain't on beating or misogyny, it's mahogany, I got bougie wood

I spent my whole career lookin' for validation
Chasin' women that use pussy for they persuasion
Chained to my vessel, saw freedom in meditation
Usin' medication would make the perfect escapist
They unprestigious, I got angels in my allegiance
My demons would look for sin like junkies feelin' fiendish
The meanest streets I walk in, these size elevens I stalk
Not carin' if I'm rich or if I'm surrounded by chalk
I could either live like Jay or die like Jah
Alhamdulillah, let Jеhovah judge me on my flaws
My word is law, forevеr stick to the code
Stay bold and to switch it up when things grow old
All I have in this world is my heart and my soul
Lay my life down for it 'cause they both made of gold
Twenty-four karats, twenty-five and countin', twenty-four hours
Days not promised, but for now, never send flowers

I'm getting tired of the bullshit
Can't keep spinning
Angels keep singing, guide me through all this

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
I spent my whole life lookin' for validation
In today's age, it would've led to my cancellation
Damnation for those, the good book of posers
Life goes to shit, thinkin' I smelled roses
Friends turn to foes and foes end up frozen
Actin' like my day ones, nigga, you're just posin'
Niggas gettin' coked up and act like they slick
Smile in my face, then go and pillow talk to a bitch
Word got back to me, so it is what it is
I don't fuck with no man who don't take care of his kids
Off-topic, out of pocket, all these niggas is trash
Fightin' for crumbs of fame and some thot with an ass, fuck 'em
Plan, plot, strategize, it's the task, I realize, right before I bomb first
You don't gotta love me, respect me, and fear me
And yes, you gotta fade me if worst come to worst
'Cause love could get you killed, playin' the victim get you bullied
I passed God's test, understood life fully
The wing-ridden angel, the horn-hidden demon
The day I go to war, this is the song I be singin'
The song I be singin'

When you broke, niggas won't throw slander
Get money, now your ass can't stand us

You got something that belongs to me

But you don't have the time to wait on me

I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you, yeah

Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose

Rider shit

[Verse 1]
Having conversations with mama, man, my life is a mess
Ain't been returning the texts, so she been reading the press
She got Google Alerts, them shits go straight to her phone
She worry 'bout me from home, you know she raised me alone
She said, ""I heard you back with you know who""
I told her, ""girl, I'm always back with you know who,"" yeah
And she like, ""Who are we kidding? You're 27, you're just being you
You're your father's child, man, thank God you got some me in you""
At least I always, at least I always see it through
At least I'm always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher, but your words still got me evolvin'
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solvin'
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that there's someone better
Like that girl from your gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free Thursday
And I'm sure that she's an angel, but she don't want this life
The timing ain't right
Maybe one day, but even one day with us is the time of her life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart
But I'm not here to give out compliments
Or boost nobody's confidence, momma
I got no friends in this, momma
I don't pretend with this, momma
I'on joke with this, momma
I pull the knife out my back and I cut they throat with it, momma
I'm Game of Thrones with it, momma
I'm Home Alone with it, momma
I'm t-
I really hate using this tone with you, momma
I really hate gettin' aggressive on this phone with you, momma
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two, momma
It's just they cloning me, momma
Them niggas wannabes, momma
Its like - I'm the one they wanna be, momma
I just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable, momma
I mean I kill 'em every time they do a song with me, momma
I sing a hook they sing along with me, momma
What more they want  from me, momma?
Yeah, this is a crazy life
But you and the six raised me right
""Don't ever take advice,"" that was great advice
You might also like[Refrain]
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life

[Verse 2]
Yeah!
Having conversations with momma, we start talkin' 'bout dad
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga Memphis for real, girl, he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept
But he just want our forgiveness, and fuck it, look how we're living
I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like
I used to rap on the phone with one of his friends doing life
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason
Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?
Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny
Shit could've gone south for me, he looked out for me, ma
He never let me do drugs
He let me shoot a gun one summer, but out there everyone does
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music
Shit that can only be created if you go through it
I used to get teased for being black
And now I'm here and I'm not black enough
'Cause I'm not acting tough
Or making stories up 'bout where I'm actually from, yeah
But I just roll with it, momma, rolling stone with it, momma
Gotta be careful around Rolling Stone
Or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me, momma
I'm not condoning it, momma
They will not tear nothing down, I built this home for you, momma
Know I don't call enough, momma
I just been working with so little time for personal, momma, yeah

I put my heart and my all in my art, I'm alternate
All of them are the same, it's harder to tell 'em apart some days
I thought I'd call 'em out altogether
Rather than waste the amount of bars it'll take for me to call 'em out by name
Caught a glimpse of the alternate world I've introduced to you

You can't be everything to everybody

I wanna damn near kill you to be the one that heal you up
I wanna be the one to fill you up
On nights when you need good dick to cheer you up
I wanna be the one to build you up
A wall worth five billion bucks to keep out the rah-rah
And the blah-blah-blah so nobody try to steal your thunder
Pull you under
Toss my hoes out, Royal Rumble
We done moved out to the boondocks
Built a big house, there he wonders
How somewhere along the way
He went from Huey to Eddie Wuncler
I been so disconnected, my perspective is ignorant
When you rich, niggas don't wanna correct you
Say something crazy, they won't interject
Do every drug that you want, they gon' let you
Dangerous when it's nobody to check you
I be havin' to check myself
Nigga, stop holding that money, you know you got plenty
I be havin' to spread my wealth
I used to be at the crib myself
7 years old, off of Bragg Boulevard
Where they bag up the raw
They gon' stand on the corner, one hand on they balls
And they ran when the cops come, there go the laws
Then I packed up a bag and I trapped it up north on the path of a star
And I ran into you like I met you before
Now damn, me and you goin' half on a boy, sing

Huggin' the block, huggin' the block all day
I had nowhere to go, she gave me a place to stay
She gave me her heart to hold, I still got that shit to this day
She ridin' with me on the road, she ridin' with me in the A
Huggin' the block, huggin' the block, okay
She gave me the gift of my son, and plus we got one on the way
She gave me a family to love, for that, I can never repay
I'm crying while writing these words, the tears, they feel good on my face, hey

Went back to the ends, met two shotguns
Started banging on friends
There's one thing I've always said
My N9 ting hold it down to the end

Heard the Farm yutes were having a block party
So we went around there, six man on a ped
The cheeks comе ride on us, déjà vu, you will get kwengеd
Then I get bagged for a Section 4
KMT, they're doing it again
On the desk, I'm talking to the Sarg'
Hold on, it's two firearms instead
Now I'm in jail for possession with intent
Watching Match of the Day, keeping up with the Prem'
I remember them Zanco calls
Man said ""Fuck beef, just focus on bread""
I thank God everyday I bussed that case, E1, I'm blessed
I thank God everyday I bussed that case, E1, I'm blessed
Touched road, made Just The Beginning
It was just the beginning for these fucking GMs
Bad B wan' whine and kotch
Just copped a new dots, will you hold this skeng?
Started off with a rambo, then a dotty, you know what's next
I saw three young G's in the ends, G-check
Them man try do up pretend
These times, they were opps, should've banged on them
One give a snake ching and the others fled
After that, the beef got intense
We was rolling with guns, and this beef can't end
Then I hit 'em with Out Till Late
We were out 'til late, just getting 'em vexed
Went jail again
Now I'm back on the V, tryna see who's leng
It was me, Nutty and Tiny
Straight on crash, don't care about spends
But you know we're still top scoring
N17 got left in a mess
We're the ones that made Spurs hot
Derby goals like Lacazette
I touch down, I'm on tag, I'm stressed
They run up on me for attempted M's
At 10, I found out he's dead
It's not my fault he can't order again
Then I chuckled a bit
They were scraping walls, tryna hop that fence
I didn't get girls back then
But I tell you for sure now they all get wet
I didn't get girls back then
But I tell you for sure now they all get wet
Then I showed you the life I live
'Cah the life that I live's too fuckin' risky
He lost his kidney, so how the fuck can his bredrins diss me?
How can you ask if the 9's got guns?
Don't be silly, check the history
I still gotta order some wings
But Chicken's the best when it comes from Dixy
There's still M's and attempted murders
They're tryna get my niggas just birded
Free Tiny, he's an innocent person
Free Lego too, not guilty the verdict

Keep in my mind
I was fine but this little hiccup's
Got me lying in my bed
Meeting 4am again
More lines of speak to me
Let me in
I′m good I'm fine
Think I've got this friend
Yeah stress makes for better tales
But sex makes for better sales
A slave to this very world

From little girls to grown women
From they won′t let us inside
Now we own the buildings
This isn′t a manifestation of my imagination
This was written long before my parents got acquainted
So I'm stating
What God has put in plan
Let no man
Take that vision
And
Take your cans
And make them cannots
I′ve got the gems right in my hands
I'm feeling just like Thanos
I′ll put dent up on your van
If you try cross my lane

You can't ride this wave

And effect some change

Found my inspiration
In the silence of the basement
Patient

Because I'm good enough
I see these people on the bus
Heads down
Instead of looking up
Swiping for the love
Views and likes
Comments like a drug
I had to turn around
And pull that plug

How can I fucking win
Comparing others to my kin
Comments on the colour of my skin
Got me flicking through
A couple say that I′m the king
A couple say that I got this double chin
It's fucking grim
I spend the next hour
Looking in the mirror
Wonder if I'm really getting bigger
My hair thinner
Heart breaking as I grow a little bitter
Getting jealous to the glamor and the glitter
But it′s not real life

Close my eyes
Had to take my time
Realise that the life I find
Is not the life online
Locked my phone off
And walked outside
And looked up to the sun that shines

Estilhaço na estrada
É o projeto da casa
É o corpo na cama
É o carro enguiçado
É a lama, é a lama

É um passo é uma ponte
É um sapo, é uma rã
É um resto de mato
Na luz da manhã

São as águas de março
Fechando o verão
E a promessa de vida
No teu coração

É pau, é pedra
É o fim do caminho
É um resto de toco
É um pouco sozinho

É uma cobra é um pau
É João é José
É um espinho na mão
É um corte no pé

São as águas de março
Fechando o verão
É a promessa de vida
No teu coração
É pau, é pedra
É o fim do caminho
É um resto de toco
É um pouco sozinho

É um passo é uma ponte
É um sapo, é uma rã
É um belo horizonte
É uma febre terçã

São as águas de março
Fechando o verão
É a promessa de vida
No teu coração

É pau, é pedra
É o fim do caminho
É um resto de toco
É um pouco sozinho4Embed"

[Intro: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window (Window)
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)
[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window (Window)
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There prob'ly was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her? I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you prob'ly hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold for you, for four hours, and you just said, ""no""
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver? You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else, so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan—P.S. We should be together too
[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window (Window)
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey

It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months, and still no word—I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' ninety on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now—I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together—think about it!
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you, and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim—shut up, bitch! I'm tryna talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up—see? I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh, shit, I forgot—how am I supposed to send this shit out?!
[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window (Window)
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was—it was you

...Man, whatever

[Intro]
Dre, just let it run
Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
Ayo
This song is for anyone
Fuck it, just shut up and listen
Ayo
[Verse 1]
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this, on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension, dispensin' these sentences
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off
Of this chest and I rest again peacefully
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
To not come and speak to me
I don't know you, and no, I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. *NSYNC, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you ten feet in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you, I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Ha, I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses""
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
Havin' this happenin', then attack
Eminem 'cause I rap this way, but I'm glad
'Cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn
And it's burnin', and I have returned
[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Ha, I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 3]
I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top a ""My Name Is""
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
To deal with these cocky Caucasians who think
I'm some wigger who just tries to be Black 'cause I talk
With an accent and grab on my balls so they always
Keep askin' the same fuckin' questions
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where, and the how
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out (Argh)
'Cause they drivin' me crazy, I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without
Someone standin' by it! No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad
[Chorus]
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am

They feel most comfortable in groups, less guilt to swallow. They are us. This is what we have become. Afraid to respect the individual. A single person within a circumstance can move one to change.

Ezra Collective,What Am I to Do?,"2 ContributorsWhat Am I to Do? Lyrics[Intro]
One, one, one
Two, two, two, two
Two, two

[Verse 1]
You can find me where the city meets the skyline
Knocking back the whiskey like it's white wine
Says she's finished work and so I bide time
Until I take her guard off and put it down beside mine
It's fine, we watch the world go by
Saw the whole world through my girl's own eyes
And they were pale like the photo size
'Cause everybody talks the truth, no she knows those guys, but who?really, nothing of concern, see the city's on fire
Watch the bridges as they burn
I disappear now I'm wishing she'd return
At the same time, wishing I could learn
All this paper that I earned
The first bird gets the worm
The second mouse gets the cheese, trust
And I been sat down doing this with ease
Too much, PS, someone take it for me please, please

[Chorus]
Can't get up
Spine won't let up
Lump in my neck
Ain't got time for a check up
I'm fed up
But what am I to do?
I'm worried 'bout you
My mind won't let up
Lump in my neck
Ain't got time for a check up
I'm fed up
But what am I to do
If I'm worried 'bout you?
You might also like[Verse 2]
I didn't write a second verse
So I'll kick a free
I'm all about being me
LC ripping mics in the place to be
Ezra Collective, we do this frequently
It's me on the flipping mic
Yeah, I said it right
I say it twice if I do this like every night
Shouts to Jorja
Met on the stage, grab a water
Now I talk to missus 'bout her daughter
Yeah, I oughta switch up the flow a bit
Let me see if I can come a bit more legit
In a boat, no joke
I don't smoke
Give a toke, I don't do that
Coming with some new raps, so who's that?
LC on the bigger mic
I might have said that twice
But anyways, let me get away and come back
Kickin' real raps
Yeah, have that

[Chorus]
Let up
Won't let up
Lump in my neck
Ain't got time for a check up
I'm fed up, ah
But what am I to do?
I'm worried 'bout you
My mind won't let up
Lump in my neck
Ain't got time for a check up
I'm fed up
But what am I to do
If I'm worried 'bout you?
[Verse 3]
Yo, I wrote another 15 or 16
I never worry, keep my **** clean
I seen drugs ruin lives of the pristine
From the brown, all the way down to the stiff green
The streets are mean but my mother ain't
And every late night, yeah, my mum would wait
And when I staggered home, drunk in a dumberstate
Say it straight, she'd fix me a plate, stuff it in my face
I'd never run around the bits with the bangers really
But still the bangers in the bits either fan or fear me
'Cause if I talk about my feelings and them man are near me
Chuck in some raps then a dapps, they can see it clearly
'Cause it's inside of them
I grab the paper and I ride the pen
Livin' this life, I ain't tryna end
So I can kick it for a foe, never mind a friend
Waiting for feelings like can rhyme again

[Chorus]
Ah, can't get up
Mind won't let up
Lump in my neck
Ain't got time for a check up
I'm fed up
But what am I to do?
I'm worried 'bout you
My mind won't let up
Lump in my neck
Ain't got time for a check up

The day that I met you I started dreaming
Now I write 'em down if I remember in the mornin' time
I don't know that much about Kingston
But I like the sound it makes when it starts pouring rain
I think that tonight I'll leave my light on
'Cause I get lonely when it's out and I miss you right about now

Baby, tell me where you want to go
Baby, tell me what you want to know
Give you everything I have and more

He said, ""Baby,""—that's what he called me—""I love you""
Every single word you say makes me feel some type of way
It's the thought of you that slightly scares me
But it takes my breath away, forget what I was gonna say
The day that I met you I started dreaming
Now I write 'em down if I remember in the mornin' time

I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin'
I had no chance to prepare, I couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothin'
Ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Verse 1]
If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking
If you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
We'd drive to Syd's
Had the X6 back then, back then
No matter what I did, my waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then, we were friends

'Round your city, 'round the clock
Everybody needs you
No, you can't make everybody equal
Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody bein' honest with you
Breathe 'til I evaporated

And I know it better than most people
I don't trust 'em anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some gushy, have a calm night
Shooters killin' left and right
Workin' through your worst night
If I get my money right
You know I won't need you
And I tell you (Bitch)
I hope the sack is full up
I'm fuckin', no, I'm fucked up
Spend it when I get that
I ain't tryna keep you
Can't keep up a conversation
Can't nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up?

Still, I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool when it's still alive

You were such a habit to call
I ain't myself at all, had to tell myself, ""Naw

I didn't wanna get her involved
By dinner Mr. Benjamin was sitting in awe
Hopped into my car; drove far
Far's too close and I remember my memory's no sharp
Butter knife, what a life, anyway
I'm building y'all a clock, stop, what am I, Hemingway?
She had the kind of body that would probably intimidate
Any of 'em that were un-southern, not me, cousin
If models are made for modelin'
Thick girls are made for cuddlin'
Switch worlds and we can huddle then
Who needs another friend? I need to hold your hand
You'd need no other man, we'd flee to other lands

Slammin', half a thang of heroin in the bathroom
Keep an AK and the backup in the backroom
Cook a meal clean and she suck me like a vacuum
Took a vacation to the county, I'll be back soon
Sent a couple zeroes, money on my J pay
Payin' off the COs, smokin' on the gateway
Word around the block when I was locked, she gave my thang away
'Bout to have a baby with a nigga, that's what they say
Damn, well please say it ain't so
Took off the glove, say it's love when it ain't though
Her classmate was comin' over, that was strange though
Apparently the homework ain't all he came for
Maybe you's a stank ho, maybe that's a bit mean
Maybe you grew up and I'm still living like I'm sixteen
Like a child running wild in these city streets
Man, I put that bitch up on her feet, she cut a nigga deep

[Interlude]
Damn, bitch, that's why I treat these hoes the way I treat them
That's deeper than a motherfucker, baby
You know what I'm saying?

[Verse 2]
Slammin', smack it up and flip it then I rub it down
Zip it up and then I ship it to another town
Smoking hella weed while me and Willie bust a couple pounds
She used to like that type of shit now we don't fuck around
Girl you used to say them other niggas wasn't hood enough
Got your lil degree now niggas from the hood ain't good enough
Bitch, you wasn't trippin' when that old school was pullin' up
You was short on mids at your college, who would put them up?
Uhh, well bitch, I'm out here puttin' on
I hope you feel the pain I'm feelin' when you hear this song
Don't want a nigga that's gon' slang shit up in your home
But you ran off and got engaged, man, that shit was wrong
All to a nigga that don't got nothin' that I ain't got
Only difference is he tryna be a fuckin' astronaut

Ain't trippin' cause you got a nigga, I just think you rushin'
But leavin' him to be with me ain't part of our discussion
Plus I'm on the road now, different colored hoes now
Laid back on the dope, I'm getting dollars off my shows now
Bitches wanna tie me down but I ain't in that mode now
Five years later, why you calling up my phone now?
Uhh, well bitch, how you get the number?
Like every other month, I'm switching up that motherfucker
Back on the bus, I used to fingerfuck her singing Usher
Down on my luck and then she up and left me for a sucker
I reminisce on all the crazy shit we did

Look

[Chorus: Dave & Fredo]
Let's keep it real
If money talks, then why them man there speakin' still?
""I heard you and her doing a ting?"" Nah, babe
We're just speaking, still, chill
My girl like five foot three when she's in heels
I mean, I've just seen feds on the M way
Let's keep it facts
If money talks, then why them man there speakin' back?
""I heard you and her doing a ting?"" Nah, G
It ain't even that, cap
My young boy love riding out, he don't even trap, yo

[Verse 1: Fredo]
She wanna leave with the kid
Like my cases, I'm beatin' it quick
Yo, why you still speakin' your shit?
Money talks, you don't need any lips
I got robbers that's runnin' with me
When you see us, best tuck in the piece
I don't shit in the trap, no touchin' them seats
If I'm in there, I'm flushin' the ki's
Free Blacks, they handed him time
Like my Audi, he'll handle it fine
Disrespect me, I'll bang on the nine
We come next day like Amazon Prime
If we go, we're takin' a Glock
She likes my clothes, she's takin' them off
My tape took long, if you waited, I'm soz
But first we had to drop tape on their block
Yo, you know what's funny to me?
Three hundred racks ain't no money to me
You're broke, that's why she act funny to be
Bro, you better just run it to me
Now them shows are a hundred a fee
I cooked *****, done him for free
My plug for a present, it's coming for cheap
Them boxes I got ain't for under no tree
Cocaine, no weed on the scale
No gossip, we leave it to girls
Trap boys, so easy to tell
Got more soda than Kenan and Kel
No I don't dance, I money walk
Whipping up with the money fork
Them man been chattin' for days
But me? I let my money talk

[Intro: Fuerza Regida, Manuel Turizo & Ambos]
Ey, baby, I miss you
A ver cuándo te vuelvo a ver, mija
Te extraño
Fuerza Regida
Manuel Turizo

[Verso 1: Fuerza Regida & Manuel Turizo]
Una cerveza puede ayudar a que salgas de mi cabeza
No te gustaba el dinero y fue la simpleza
De tus ojitos dormilones al mirar
Cómo te extraño, agarrarte la piernita e ir manejando
En el camino nos estábamos besando
Siempre algo mágico tenía que pasar

[Coro: Fuerza Regida]
Y ahora mi rutina completamente cambió
Ya no me divierten los amigos y еl alcohol
Estoy manejando y la neta ya no sé pa' dónde voy
Ahora mе declaro que soy un antisocial
Siempre había ganado y contigo me fue muy mal
Ya no quiero ser el hombre de antes, la verdad que en realidad
Porque sería fatal

Ahora estoy solo, pero con tu recuerdo yo me casé
Canciones tristes, todas me las sé
Coronar sin ti es como que fracasé, ey-ey
Ahora despierto todas las mañanas queriendo tomarme tus ojos café
Duele pero tengo fe
Te necesito a ti, no necesito un médico
Mis pedas, to'as te las dedico
Lo mejor que yo he tenido no lo compró mi tarjeta de crédito
Ayer soñé que volvías, qué bonita te veías
Te abracé mientras callabas, te besé mientras reías

[Verso 3: Fuerza Regida]
Tengo en mi cama una morrita que ni sé cómo se lla—
Se me hace injusto que ella sea la que la paga
Que de tu cuerpo yo no me pueda olvidar
¿Qué estás haciendo?
¿Por qué no regresas a mis brazos corriendo?
¿Dónde quedó lo que dijimos hace tiempo?
Planes de casa, niños y un perro comprar

[Coro: Manuel Turizo, Fuerza Regida & Ambos]
Y ahora mi rutina completamente cambió
Ya no me divierten los amigos ni el alcohol

A92, Fumez the Engineer, Plugged In, gang
Yo, Charlie, I like this one
92, baby, it's K

[Verse 1: A9Ksav]
I’ll swing my arm in a figure of eight, or I won't leave till the whole clip empty
Them boy ain't nuttin' but paigons, I can see why them boy love envy
I want-I want-I want LV, Prada, or Gucci, I might just offend my opps in Fendi
And when juice get spilled like soda, no, I won't say no words like Kenny

[Verse 2: A9Dbo Fundz]
My hand ting comin' like Corona, if it coughs twice then it's turnin' you pack
They say that we come like athletes, circle your block and we do them laps
All out attack, tryna get this paigon, all out attack in the fields, don't lack
He thought hе was big like Mac till I pulled out this stick, tryna swing for backs

[Verse 3: A92 BT]
In the bando, no Kay, but I still makе K’s from this Lyca sim
The jake boys irritate my skin, can't put me in the bin, no comment, can't sing
Don't sing like 6, don't snitch like 9
Still circle the 9 two times
With a machine, no gym, tryna put him in the sky
Make an opp boy fly, get whacked by mine

[Verse 4: Offica]
Where them at? Where them dey? Where the paigons?
Make the boy's eyes look like an Asian
Man, we get round there on any occasion, it ain't a ride out, it's an invasion
And if you fuck with them, it's a simple equation, you're an opp boy, you're a paigon
A ti lo a ti dé, more time when we slide round there, it's a quick ting, no calculation
You might also like[Verse 5: A9Ksav]
By God’s grace, I don't end up a lifer, but I still slide, see me a real rider
I ying-yang like China, rip 2 G's, make them drip like designer
On the block, dressed in black like Chyna
Fresh Air ones, see me in my sliders
Hopefully, I ain't got to remind you, up the A and fuck the Niners
Yo, I can't stand them boy from the 9
All they know is tell lies, tell lies, but their main boy got splashed, baptised
And another 9 boy got hospitalised
Any talk on the A get bun, drills get done by me and the guys
Dbo tryna swing for backs, he can't swing for backs, so they stay inside

[Verse 6: A9Dbo Fundz]
Scar man’s face like Al Pacino
Buck-buck-buck into A and you can hold two on the paint, no free throw
Bow, bow, now, the gun need reload
Stuck in the trap with one eye open, hopin' the cats don't jugg that kilo
Dbo Fundz, you can’t miss me on road
Fundz 'cause man's got green like Cee-Lo
Bro-bro went and bust that gun, I don't think that he’ll bust that case
They say we don't slide to the B, but Foomey’s gaff got smashed, no trace
They left Rexy fightin' for his life, on a hospital bed, got chinged broad day
A1 give her dick in her belly, which side is she on? Ask your paigon bae

[Verse 7: A92 BT]
About slide to the B, we slide to the B
How many man got chased by we and lil' man Rose got got times 3?
All the Niners watched them flee, was me and MZ tryna catch them tree
Tryna switch it like OT Chi, but I'm in OT, tryna make this cheese
I lurked down the B Town strip
I was pissed that he didn't get hit
Tell bro, ""Rise that mash and spit"", aim for his top, or aim for his wig
I seen bro grab that stick, bally on his face, he's takin' that risk
Let sticks beat like drum kit, pull up on them and pump it
Tryna let it blow like trumpets at them muppets
[Verse 8: Offica]
Bro said to hold this stick, man, you need them muscles
He let it spray like Mr. Muscles
Chocolate ting from Belgium, Brussels
She wanna go low, man, bring them bottles
Wait, she wanna jiggle and wiggle
This bad B one split in the middle
Leng, bunda come fat, not little
All my girls them sweet like Skittles
Yo, baby, how you move like that?
This gyalie wanna arch her back
Go low, limbo, limbo, touch your toe, no Elvis, baby, when I rock and roll
Me and my guys, we flow like the river
Chat loose, get one in your liver, or maybe your intestine
I got love for my gang, don't test man

[Verse 9: A9Ksav]
I got washed up opps, it's peak 'cause you man move gay, that's suttin' like Marvin
Out in the town, tryna dish these foods
Ends are hot, but these cats be starvin'
We score them goals like FIFA, but we don't commentate like Martin
No Taylor when we got down Swift
Two more down, that's no more targets

[Verse 10: A9Dbo Fundz]
I do them in my Nike tracksuit and sliders, I do that there in my LV kicks
Must be the one who's spreadin' this virus 'cause everyone knows that my flow's too sick
OT flyin', we ridin'
Out on the field, tryna catch me a prick
Bando days, we spin 'round drivin'
Wave this wand in my hand, no wiz
[Verse 11: A92 BT]
Ayy, I've been in the T with profit, bruck down buds, tryna make that profit
They chat on the net and gossip, A92, we the hottest topic
Shout SS for the pocket rocket
D-B-O got the plug like socket
I been 'round there on a madness
Watch them dash, what happened to the badness?

[Verse 12: Offica]
In the block like ""Awon da oya b’ota""
How many points have we scored in the last few weeks? Meji, merin, mefa
On the ball, twenty-two on my back like Kaká
Bro scores like Laca, shoot and they scatter
Watch them man japa

Sittin' by the phone, waitin' 'til I reply
Drying my eyes, believe it or not
I could never see a tear fallin'
Water drippin' on me like a faucet
I just took a bitch to eat at Chipotle
Spent another sixty thousand on a Rollie

She sucked my dick, it got my brain washed

Told my mama she should pray on it
Told the streets they gotta wait on it
She gon' put a nigga name on it

That's U.S. dollars that you can't achieve
Fucked my white girl, she said, ""Nigga, please""

I forgot her name but her pussy soakin'

Remindin' myself that I'm still gettin' loaded

Future Utopia,Children Of The Internet - Ezra Collective Remix,"1 ContributorChildren Of The Internet (Ezra Collective Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1: Dave]
Look
I grew up in a good but a changin' age
My wife and kids - Damon Wayans
When the youth club was everybody's favourite place
Where if you spoke to a girl then it was face-to-face
Bruh, I seen the heart of the 'hood turn trendy
Kids lose interest
Parks turn empty
Social media's got us all less friendly
Now, can't you see the irony?
She's got game when she types to me but nothing in person, that ain't the type for me
Asking ""Can we go for dinner yet?"" in the flesh
No convеrsation, no intellect
The futurе generation of the children of the internet

[Verse 2: Dave]
Look
It's all change an' I'm seeing it now
You can meet a hundred people without leaving your house
Puttin' pictures in a frame, a memory in the clouds
You know everybody keeps their memories in the cloud
We finally found a voice and we ain't speaking as loud
People only wanna listen to the sheep and the crowd
An' any other statement gets you cancelled by an activist that's never helped the cause that they're tweeting about
Do you blame public figures and personalities, for giving the li'l kids a warped views of reality?
Or blame all o' the apps that make a killing on finding the sweet spot in your self-hate and vanity?
Could you argue that it's borderline dangerous to take a picture of a girl's face and start changin' it?
With one quick filter, your nose looks thinner
Your eyes look fuller
Your lips look bigger
Your software's better and your phone knows everything
If anything, it's getting George Orwell-ian

Children of the internet
Your info collected
As a species, we now have to redefine what it means to be connected
Children of the internet
A recent study showed that average person earnestly swipes, taps, pinches their phone a million times a year
Your info collected
People feel naked, inadequate and utterly vulnerable without their phone
It's a primary conduit of personal, social and work life
Children of the internet
There are more active cell phones on the planet than people
The mobile phone is both a connection and disconnection device, and is typically placed between the human and its surroundings

Yo, I slayed MCs back in the rec room era
My style broke motherfuckin' backs like Ken Patera
Most rap niggas came loud but unheard
Once I pulled out, round 'em off to the nearest third
Check these non-visual niggas, with tapes and a portrait
Flood the seminar, tryna orbit this corporate
Industry, but what them niggas can't see
Must break through like the Wu, unexpectedly
Protect ya neck, my sword still remains imperial
Before I blast the mic, RZA scratch off the serial
We reign all year 'round from June to June
While niggas bite immediately, if not soon
Set the lynchin', inform the execution date
As this 2000 beyond slang suffocate
Amplify sample through vacuum tubes compressions
Cause RZA to charge niggas twenty G's a session

When my mind start to clickin'
And the strategy is mastered, the plot thicken

Look at mama's baby boy actin' like he grown
No time for sleep, I gets deep as a baritone
Killa bee that be holdin' down his honeycomb, loungin', son

Protect your neck, flyin' guillotines, here they come
Bloody bastards, hard times and killer tactics
Spittin' words plus semi-automatic slurs, peep the graphic

Hit the clutch, shift the gear, now full throttle
Time to bungee to the next episode, I keeps it grungy
Hand on my nut sack and spittin' lunghies
At a wack nigga that don't understand the fact

[Verse: Guru]
Beef is what's up now, careers are gettin' shut down
The media wants something meaty, people are fuckin' greedy
Music and culture is like a foreign language
You'd be better off stagin' a fake beef in Spanglish
Compadre, can you handle the whole weight?
¡Ay, Dios mío!, watch 'em swallow your whole plate
You used to support your fam off of this
Now you can't even buy SPAM off of this
And I don't deal with swine, I ain't Dr. Phil
I'll truly help to heal your mind
Nowadays it's like everybody's losin' it
Instead of them preservin' this gift, they're all abusin' it
It's mad drama, they want us reachin' for the llamas
Causin' hysteria, the new hip-hop criteria
And they forgot about the blood, sweat and tears

[Verse 1]
No way, you'll never make it
Come with the weak shit, I'll break it
Step into my zone, mad rhymes will stifle ya
Lines like rifles go blast when I kick some ass
A lot of rappers be like one-time wonders
Couldn't say a fly rhyme if there was one right under their noses
I hate those motherfuckin' posers
But I'm so real, to them, it's scary
And with my unique skills, nah, you can't compare me
And no, we don't make wack tracks
And all the suckers get pushed back when I'm kickin' real facts
I represent, set up shit like a tent, boy
You're paranoid 'cause you're a son like Elroy
And you'd be happy as hell to get a record deal
Maybe your soul you'd sell to have mass appeal

Your head'll bop when I drop my crop of pure bomb
Just like the seashore, I'm calm but wild
With my monotone style
Because I don't need gimmicks
Give me a fly beat and I'm all in it

For you, it's tragic, I got magic like wands

Get up out in these, in these streets man
Yo, so what's the deal God?
I'm sayin, what you need though?
Yo let me have like, two or three, three G's man
I'm sayin, I'm sayin son man
You know what happened last time though
I gotta do what I gotta do man, I gotta eat man
Whassup man? Oh your baby momma stressin you?

[Verse 1]
Way past the days of the deuce me and you stays a crew
Only a few percent knew what me and you went through
We've been sent to dominate, these corny come-lates
And set this crooked rap shit straight from Crenshaw to Castlegate
Like Pete and CL, I reminisce over days
From the streets of Boston to New York and all the ways
For certain niggas to blow up, and crime paid
But my praise goes to the most high
Cause some nights I got so wild yo, I almost died
Some stuff I got into, really scarred my mental
Pops wasn't tryin to hear it, cause of what he been through
Still, like my nigga Havoc said, sometimes you gotta
Hit your crew off, so they can make some bread
Cause no matter the weather, niggas be needin cheddar
And things in this world are more fucked up than ever
So let's make this bond to keep this hip-hop strong
You a man Baby Pop you know right from wrong
So stay out of trouble, and that goes for me too
That's what we need to do, that's my advice to you...

""Think twice""

[Verse 2]
My advice to you, cut down on champagne and booze
For a nigga like me, most time that shit's bad news
It's like lightin a fuse whether it's sneakers or shoes
Cause somebody always wanna step up to start a feud
It's like Set-tin It Off but not the movie
Plus let's get some real women forget floozies and the groupies
Cause they spell mad problems from Watts to Harlem
And the bullshit won't stop long as the world's revolvin
And I recall when niggas knew my pops had clout
But they didn't know my sorry ass was gettin kicked out
And they was seein if I wanted to come bubble with them
And make my ends triple and double with them
And get in trouble with them, now memories of them
I wear em in my heart like a emblem
I doubt we'd ever be bigtime sellin dope coke or dust
It's killin us, let's take our people and make a exodus
Annhilation, inhalation through the lungs
Or extermination, by the use of dirty guns
Triple beam dreams and drug schemes of mad cream
Could be a sad scene when you go to that extreme

Caress the mic and kick my game like I wanna

We come from ill life experience, and take rap serious

He's away visiting his grandmoms but I miss him dearly

[Verse 1]
Check it out
If I rhyme this, you will find this situation shall advance
You could take a glance or dance
Elevator lyrics to arouse the crowd
Now tell me who's the man to show you how
Many legacies of brothers who get busy
And I do it fluid 'til the suckers get dizzy
Saying peace to the blackbirds 125th street
And check the flow that's unique

Can't refuse this, never lose this, it's the choice this
'Cause my voice is the smoothest
Dominating to your boys 'cause I've been around doing work
And sold tons of other jerk

If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's gettin' more bleak
A fresh poison each week
We were born sick, you heard them say it

Is when I'm alone with you

Command me to be well

I know you're in love

And up in my world, we nuh sleep enuh, man
Anytime it could go down, she won't hold out
She let it all out, pow-pow-pow, pow-pow

[Verse 1: J Hus]
My favorite girl had da French braids
I had a crush on her since back-a-day
She said her 'usna needs a bandage
After I come 'round and gave her the 12-gauge
You tried call my phone, but it was engaged
I was with my lil' mama, she was honey glazed
I've been crushin' on her since back then
Just the other day I gave her the MAC-10
I don't want just any girl, 'cause I'm a little choosy
But I swear I'm a sucker for a lil' cutie
I had a skin fade like Lil Boosie
And then I went and give lil' mama the lil' uzi
'Cause you got a body shape that I can't forget
The way I make you drip when I'm talkin' slick
I'm ashamed 'cause when I came, I was bustin' quick
That's why this time I came with the banana clip

[Verse 2: J Hus]
Only God can judge me, but my friend's a lifer
My life is too fast, so I can never wife her
I'm from the East Coast but she's a Westsider
I scoped her from far 'cause I'm the best sniper
Said she had the melons, so I go and get 'em
Spray with my AK-47
The way she keeps me guessin', she is a blessin'
But she only loves me for my three-fifty-seven
I think she was Bajan or maybe Trini
Every time I linked her, I had a nine milli'
I had to link a cougar with a Luger
But the next time, I bring out the big bazooka
It's the Return of the Mack, call it the sequel
I'm known as the Mack like Beanie Sigel
Before she got undressed, she was already see-through
Then she fell in love with my Desert Eagle
[Chorus: Burna Boy]
I know you're in love
Cah mi have di MAC with di extension
And mi have di money fi ya extensions
Cah mi like your hair longer than my gun, ooh-ooh-ooh

She love me for my gunplay
But if it wasn't for my gunplay
Then she really wouldn't love me

Just 'cause I'm not jealous doesn't mean I don't care, that's just not fair
I knew you were trouble, I was unprepared
If I were married, this might turn a scandalous affair

Ayy, trouble gon' find me, trouble'll find me anywhere

No fly zone, please stay the fuck out my airspace (Out my face)

Know it's on sight when I see you, I'm workin' at Squarespace
Yeah, top of the mornin', I know that you thought I was dormant
Woke up early from shots that were swarmin'

Guess somebody got popped, now thеy knockin' on doors
Tryna find an informant but I ain't see Nathan
I'm mindin' my business as God is my witness
No weapon gon' prospеr that’s formin' against me
Nigga, I'm starvin', immensely
Know when I'm done with these songs, you gon' miss me
Ja Morant, I'm on my Grizzly
You niggas just cubs but no, not the ones in the big leagues
After The Fall Off, I promise I'm comin' to sellin' out Wrigley's
Nigga, I'm just a product of poverty, full of narcotics to profit off quickly
My family tree got a history of users that struggle with demons
Not really the hustler instincts
Therefore, often, my pockets was empty
So while some of my partners was servin' up rocks on the corners, the project assemblies
Me, I was startin' to envy, wanna be on the top where it's plenty
Wanna be in the spot like where every bitch want me like Rihanna droppin' new Fenty
What I see in the sky, the 'Ville is the ceilin', can't reach up too high, evidently
Nah, shit, I can't reach up too high, evidently

Get a couple chicks, get 'em to try to do E
Hopefully they'll ménage before I reach my garage

We shoulda been together havin' Four Seasons brunch
We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather
So now we travel first-class to change the forecast
Never in bunches, just me and you
I loved your point of view 'cause you held no punches
Still I left you for months on end
It's been months since I checked back in
We're somewhere in a small town
Somewhere lockin' a mall down
Woodgrain, four and change, Armor All'd down

You helped me get the keys to that V dot 6
We was so happy poor, but when we got rich
That's when our signals got crossed and we got flipped
Rather mine, I don't know what made me leave that shit
Made me speed that quick, let me see, that's it
It was the cheese, helped them bitches get amnesia quick
I used to cut up they buddies, now they sayin' they love me
Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldn't touch me
Then I showed up in that dubbed-out buggy
And then they got fuzzy, and they don't remember that
And I don't remember you

Word back home is that you had a special friend
So what was oh so special then?
You have given away without gettin' at me
That's your fault, how many times you forgiven me?
How was I to know that you was plain sick of me?
I know the way a nigga livin' was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that

J-I-D back in the city with it
Jiddy done been all across the globe
They say ""JID a scribbler, he silly with it""
""When he spittin', I hope he don’t sell his soul""
""He should be good, man, he signed to Cole""
""He from the hood, nigga, down the road""
""He was just juggin' right by the store""
Then they saw the patrol, it was time to roll
Saw the patrol, it was time to ride
Motor runnin' on Memorial Drive
Got a country cousin cruisin’ with the blammer
In Savannah at the Florida-Georgia line
Got a couple family members in Atlanta
Not Atlanta, we let Omerettà decide
They just gon' let that Beretta fly
'Cause you niggas buggin', spray pesticides
It's me and the bros, it's no extra guys
And they movin' weight, it's no exercise
We could pick a date to come stretch you out
Only showin’ muscle when it’s flexin' time
You could see the hustle, you could recognize
Overcame struggle when the Devil tried
Lemme bear it all when I’m tellin' God
You know I'ma rant when I talk to Jah

Nigga say that I can't, damn lie

We gon' slide on your man, landslide
There's a nine in my pants, hand cocked
You gon' try to recant, you can't now
I could step on a ant, ant pile
I'ma shoot at the ground, dance now
Dan—, ooh, dan—, pshh, dan—

[Chorus: Kenny Mason]
Oh, what a handsome gift (Yeah)
To live in the land of sin  (Uh)
Ridin' with bags and bricks (Uh)
And my lil' nasty chick (Yeah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
That's what I asked of Him (Uh)
Told me He'd grant my wish (Yeah)

[Verse 2: JID]
I'm not a two-steppin' man, I said, ""I do not dance""
It's a gun inside my pants, and the whole world's in his hands (Dance)
It depends, penny for your sins (For your sins)
Shootin' up the block, can't stop revenge (Oh)
Nappy dreadlocks like a rasta man (Rasta man)
Where the story ends and the plot begins
Uh, look, momma said, ""The messiah's in moccasins
Tryna save the kids in them apartments
And show a way to live with other options""
Opulence, decadence, black excellence and lots of it
I could cop the newest Beamer, Bentley or Balenciaga's
I could pay for this lil' nigga scholarship
I ain't caught up in rap nigga politics
Play with me and you playin' yourself
Playin' with death, say him a prayer
Cathy and Carl got a K on the shelf
I'm in DeKalb County open-carryin', caterin', chef
Cookin' up another plate of the best
Me and Christo got it poppin' like it's Crisco
Fried chicken, I'm lickin' her thighs
Then I put my face in her breasts
I took a drive, my plug on the West side
Of Atlanta, he known to finesse guys
With the hammer on Campbellton, headshots
On the camera, knock out a dreadlock
That's a felony charge, he caught a F
Niggas come to the A and get X'd out (Facts)
But I only been here 'cause I'm tryna help
Only one you can help is yourself now

Life is a journey, you know? Not a destination
Lean not towards the egoistic intonations (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Positive vibrations bring real liberation (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
It's the will of the heart, the strength of the mind
And the love of the creator that will help us rise out of these sadistic situations (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
And experience the purity that exists in our creation, you know? (Oh, oh, oh, oh)9Embed"

Peewee tried to swang on me, but I was with likе fifty folks and he ain't know

We was toted, we was soldiers, we was soulless
We was sold, they sayin' somethin' 'bout his set
Nigga, that who he swangin' for
Swear you bitches don't know shit about our stress, about our woes
And my obsession with success by definition of my own
Sure as death is waitin' on our flesh and bones
Demon callin' my spirit, had to click the phone
Couldn't get to Courtney quick enough to give her warm big hugs
Told her, ""You like the strongest woman on the fuckin' globe""
I watch my momma lose her momma
Go through drama and trauma but had to keep her head high
So we don't fuckin' know
I'm gettin' older, so when the world's feelin' enormous on your back and on your arms (Ooh)
And your feet just as heavy you been draggin' through the storm (Oh)

I'm on the road and I bet that your ho with me
When I'm in traffic, it's always a pole wit' me
Pillsbury man, I keep dough with me (Can't you see?)
Hit from the back, she givin' me slurp, and I ain't even pull my pants down
Jump in the box and slide to the other side, it's always a man down
Draw down, hands in the air, nigga, make one move, get gunned down
Givin' out smoke so long, they don't even wanna talk no more, they just run now (Can't you see?)
No locked doors, I serve with a chop
Bitch got spent, she was hangin' with a opp
We call him Mickey, he talk to the cops
I was on Pinedale, glass in the sock

Fast forward, now I'm investin' in stocks

Only down when there's liquor 'round or the spliff around
That's why I don't fuck with niggas now
Well I fuck with all my niggas, you know the difference
You been living with tunnel vision
You and all of your friends are like wonder women
Wonder Woman working for it if you ever wanted something
Searching for a purpose, I see what you on
Difference in how you be using your gifts
In the midst of the shit that you dealing with
Really specific, you paid attention, panoramic
Got the vision like a fer-de-lance
You attack and you kill it, sinkin' your teeth with the venom
Kinda like me with these instrumentals
Or the pen and the pencil or off the-
Pimpin' since been pimpin', keep it sensible
Since you winning, you a object of ridicule
Objects appearing closer than you ready for
Obviously you don't know what's ahead
But that's the reason you can work 'til you dead

And much too blind to see the damage he's done
Sometimes a man must awake to find that really, he has no one

So I'll wait for you, and I'll burn
Will I ever see your sweet return?
Oh, will I ever learn?

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
Lover, you should've come over
'Cause it's not too late
Mhm

[Verse 4]
Lonely is the room, the bed is made
The open window lets the rain in
Burning in the corner is the only one
Who dreams he had you with him

[Refrain]
My body turns and yearns
For a sleep that won't ever come

[Bridge]
It's never over
My kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
It's never over
All my riches for her smiles when I slept so soft against her
It's never over
All my blood for the sweetness of her laughter
It's never over
She's the tear that hangs inside my soul forever
Oh, but maybe I'm just too young
To keep good love from going wrong
[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Lover, you should've come over
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yes, I, I feel too young to hold on
And much too old to break free and run
Too deaf, dumb, and blind to see the damage I've done
Sweet lover, you should've come over
How long will I wait for you?
Lover, lover, lover
Lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
Lover, lover, lover, you should've come over

I'm lying in my bed, the blanket is warm
This body will never be safe from harm
Still feel your hair, black ribbons of coal
Touch my skin to keep me whole

Oh, if only you'd come back to me
If you laid at my side
Wouldn't need no Mojo Pin
To keep me satisfied

Memories fire, the rhythms fall slow
Black Beauty, I love you so

Oh, precious, precious, silver and gold
And pearls in oyster's flesh
Drop down, we two to serve
And pray to love
Born again from the rhythm
Screaming down from heaven

Money ain't a thing if I got it
Mo—mo—mo—mo—mo
Money ain't a thing if I got it
Money—Money

[Chorus]
Before the money there was love
But before the money it was tough
Then came the money through a plug
It's a shame this ain't enough, yo

[Verse 1]
Sittin' back plottin', jottin' information on my nation
Really started from the bottom, boy cotton
But they still plantin' plantations, we keep buyin' in
Closed-minded men, pride is higher than the prices on your Pradas and
Balenciagas Balance my saga with the Henny agua
Me and my niggas tryna eat, you pussies empanada
The flow like plenty lava, with just a penny I could
Multiply my worth and make you work for me for twenty hours
I swear these niggas love to copy, thanks for listening
The kid ain't been the same since Biggie smacked me at my christenin'
Watch what you dishin' and please play it safe
'Cause your position on the top is switchin' right in front your face
Rock you outta space with rhymes, I'm bustin' out
Keep duckin' down, got some missiles now, headed for your house
So put the pistols down, got that red dot on your nose
Who booked the clown? I lock jaws like a blue nose, foes
Keep your mouth closed or you can see the solar
I got connections that guaranteed to see closed doors
You hear that underground sonar
The way I flows then switch them, the Pros been on a mission, listen
Enter the chamber, get hyperbolic
They raisin' MACs, I raise stakes to keep them brolic
My visions is macrocosmic, pass the chronic
The mastered sonics is light years above your conscious
You're novice, but I got notes that strike nerves
I promise your minds ain't sharp like my swords
So cut the BS, and don't worry where my jeans is
And PS, ""Your bitch a genius, learned from my penis, I got""
Dreams sellin' arenas and breaking brackets
Tenants racket, while I'm crackin' a Serena
God damn, God bless the heaven that sent you
But now I'm breezing out, baby, cause my rent's due

Alright I want you to hear somethin'
I'mma play somethin' for you alright?
Alright, alright
Yo yo you hear it bro?

[Intro]
Yeah
Alright listen, listen
Let me tell you what shit is like right now y'all

[Verse 1]
What's life like now, tryna figure out
They put this mic on trial cause he be killin' now
Forever bitin' my forbidden style
Been laying low for a minute in the game
Since I came all these niggas lookin' timid
My light could never dimith, the Lord is my shepherd
Jesus woke a devil in him since sinnin' with least effort
Thinking back to those lefferts days
And I ain't been the same since I left 6th grade
My mind strayed, used to have the biggest heart
Taking walks with abuela in the park, I used to tell her
I'ma grow propellers one day and be a good fella
Play the hero or whoever, the hood gon' tell us
Let's just pray it ain't the villain
Till then I be feeling some way
Thinkin' I can get the Maybach off gun play
Instead I let the words play with 90 beats a minute
Bet the streets lose a heart beat before the verse finish
But life goes on, basic rules still apply
Bet you can feel that line in any hood you live by
From Flatbush to Figg side, I was a schoolboy too
Hoppin' trains, I just missed my Q

Just keep ya head up G, shit is wild
It's bugged out cause I know you tryna see your child
But I'mma hold you down still cause you my brother
I just gave Will a lil' somethin' for your baby mother
But don't stress, know you caught up in some b.s
Bet next time you see us, we gonna be our best
Love you my nigga, word is bond, you'll stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is goin' on
Peace to all my brothers who keep still holdin' on
Been away so long, feel like a tickin' time bomb
The misjudgment of my kind, whom the odds is against
Put our backs on the fence, so we self defence
Followed by a series of unfortunate events
Looking like white America got a brother again

And what's life like for me, it's but a dream
Everything ain't what it seems, up underneath
The surface is but a screen, we only see

I never knew a love that wasn't painless

Like nobody in the hood was fucking with my shit
And that's real shit

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
Since '95 momma been working nine-five
And I know the landlord fed up with our lies
So we pray to the gods, the Jahs and the Allahs
To keep us safe and watch our lives
'Cause all we tryna do is do good
Put on my hood when I walk through hoods
'Cause these niggas these days is loco
You'll get it in ya vocals if you ain't a local
Yeah, that's why I'm tryna go global
Yeah, that's why I'm tryna be a mogul
And I'm hopeful that me spittin' it soulful
Will have me in the Daily Postal, flying coastal, eatin' tofu
Like I told you, I know niggas who trash rappin'
Worried bout the trendin' fashions rather than ascendin' passion
They want me send 'em tracks but I just send 'em laughter
Right after I start laughin', they start askin' ""What happened?""
But back to the chapter
Momma told me ""follow dreams"", should never have to ask her to
So that’s what I do, became an MC master
Since then it’s been a disaster for you and your favorite rapper
Go ahead, ask 'em ""Who is Joey Bad?""
Watch 'em gasp, asthma, damn, it’s so sad
He paused the chatter 'cause he know he rather back up
Than to admit the kid is hotter than magma
But fuck it, you gotta give credit where it's due
'Cause you ain't gon' like the karma when it's set up on you
It can get you on your medical, fuck you up in the decimals
Or get you 2 to 3 for residue found in your retinal
Uh, and they told me not to be so complex
Dumb it down to accomplish articles in Complex
And The Source — alfredo, of course
There I go again, steppin' out of line, runnin' off course
I heard reports that it's like sexual intercourse
With your thoughts when I talk about the shoes in which I walk
For it is not faux, nor false that this kid from the north
Speaks with forced supports of reinforced assaults
I'm sure by now you can assume he never lost
Unless with some form of divorce, or a corpse
Born boss, no days off, child labor
Let me see those in favor to spin that back like tornadoes

Anybody that talk about me got problems, you know what I'm sayin'?
It's gonna be straight-up, like if I was a street person
That's how I'm comin' at the whole world
And I'm being real about it and I'ma grow with my music

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
Yeah, but it's far from over
Won't stop 'til I meet Hova and my momma's in a Rover
'Til I'm an owner of the world's finest motors
I blow like supernovas in your daughter's room on a poster
Known as history's biggest musical composer
No disrespect to Bob Mar, but yeah, another stoner
Marijuana my odor, and when I get older
Hope my spermatozoa from my scrotum intercepts an ovum
Like three times, have three kids
I hope me and my wife can show 'em not to make the same mistakes you know that we did
I hope they acknowledge the knowledge
'Cause yeah, they gon' need it
'Cause when my parents tried to tell me, I just wouldn't receive it
Couldn't believe it, till I saw with my own pupils
Felt bad when I learned that their advice was truly useful
But fuck it, only made us as human beings more mutual
Even though over time, my punishments, they grew more crucial
Should use the word brutal, 'cause my parents mad strict
Hope one day I'll attract the likes of even Madlib
Go gold on mad shit and hear my songs mastered
Until then, all I can do is imagine
[Outro]
Imagine, I'ma make it all happen

ENTER LA-FOOLE, CLERIMONT, AND DAW.
La-F:
Where had you our swords, master Clerimont?

Cler:
Why, Dauphine took them from the madman.

La-F:
And he took them from our boys, I warrant you.

Cler:
Very like, sir.

La-F:
Thank you, good master Clerimont. Sir John Daw and I are
both beholden to you.

Cler:
Would I knew how to make you so, gentlemen!

Daw:
Sir Amorous and I are your servants, sir.
[ENTER MAVIS.]

Mav:
Gentlemen, have any of you a pen and ink? I would fain write
out a riddle in Italian, for sir Dauphine, to translate.

Cler:
Not I, in troth lady; I am no scrivener.

Daw:
I can furnish you, I think, lady.

[EXEUNT DAW AND MAVIS.]

Cler:
He has it in the haft of a knife, I believe.

La-F:
No, he has his box of instruments.

Cler:
Like a surgeon!

La-F:
For the mathematics: his square, his compasses, his brass
pens, and black-lead, to draw maps of every place and person
where he comes.
Cler:
How, maps of persons!

La-F:
Yes, sir, of Nomentack when he was here, and of the Prince of
Moldavia, and of his mistress, mistress Epicoene.

[RE-ENTER DAW.]

Cler:
Away! he hath not found out her latitude, I hope.

La-F:
You are a pleasant gentleman, sir.

Cler:
Faith, now we are in private, let's wanton it a little, and
talk waggishly.—Sir John, I am telling sir Amorous here, that you
two govern the ladies wherever you come; you carry the feminine
gender afore you.

Daw:
They shall rather carry us afore them, if they will, sir.

Cler:
Nay, I believe that they do, withal—but that you are the
prime men in their affections, and direct all their actions—
Daw:
Not I: sir Amorous is.

La-F:
I protest, sir John is.

Daw:
As I hope to rise in the state, sir Amorous, you have the
person.

La-F:
Sir John, you have the person, and the discourse too.

Daw:
Not I, sir. I have no discourse—and then you have activity
beside.

La-F:
I protest, sir John, you come as high from Tripoly as I do,
every whit: and lift as many join'd stools, and leap over them,
if you would use it.

Cler:
Well, agree on't together knights; for between you, you
divide the kingdom or commonwealth of ladies' affections: I see
it, and can perceive a little how they observe you, and fear you,
indeed. You could tell strange stories, my masters, if you would,
I know.

Daw:
Faith, we have seen somewhat, sir.

La-F:
That we have—velvet petticoats, and wrought smocks, or so.

Daw:
Ay, and—

Cler:
Nay, out with it, sir John: do not envy your friend the
pleasure of hearing, when you have had the delight of tasting.

Daw:
Why—a—do you speak, sir Amorous.

La-F:
No, do you, sir John Daw.

Daw:
I'faith, you shall.

La-F:
I'faith, you shall.

Daw:
Why, we have been—

La-F:
In the great bed at Ware together in our time. On, sir
John.

Daw:
Nay, do you, sir Amorous.

Cler:
And these ladies with you, knights?

La-F:
No, excuse us, sir.

Daw:
We must not wound reputation.

La-F:
No matter—they were these, or others. Our bath cost us
fifteen pound when we came home.

Cler:
Do you hear, sir John? You shall tell me but one thing
truly, as you love me.

Daw:
If I can, I will, sir.

Cler:
You lay in the same house with the bride, here?

Daw:
Yes, and conversed with her hourly, sir.

Cler:
And what humour is she of? Is she coming, and open, free?

Daw:
O, exceeding open, sir. I was her servant, and sir Amorous was
to be.

Cler:
Come, you have both had favours from her: I know, and have
heard so much.

Daw:
O no, sir.

La-F:
You shall excuse us, sir: we must not wound reputation.

Cler:
Tut, she is married now, and you cannot hurt her with any
report; and therefore speak plainly: how many times, i'faith?
which of you led first? ha!

La-F:
Sir John had her maidenhead, indeed.

Daw:
O, it pleases him to say so, sir, but sir Amorous knows what
is what, as well.

Cler:
Dost thou i'faith, Amorous?

La-F:
In a manner, sir.

Cler:
Why, I commend you lads. Little knows don Bridegroom of
this. Nor shall he, for me.

Daw:
Hang him, mad ox!

Cler:
Speak softly: here comes his nephew, with the lady Haughty.
He'll get the ladies from you, sirs, if you look not to him in
time.

La-F:
Why, if he do, we'll fetch them home again, I warrant you.

[EXIT WITH DAW. CLER. WALKS ASIDE.]

[ENTER DAUPHINE AND HAUGHTY.]

Hau:
I assure you, sir Dauphine, it is the price and estimation
of your virtue only, that hath embark'd me to this adventure; and
I could not but make out to tell you so; nor can I repent me of
the act, since it is always an argument of some virtue in our
selves, that we love and affect it so in others.

Daup:
Your ladyship sets too high a price on my weakness.

Hau:
Sir, I can distinguish gems from pebbles—

Daup [ASIDE.]:
Are you so skilful in stones?

Hau:
And howsover I may suffer in such a judgment as yours, by
admitting equality of rank or society with Centaure or Mavis—

Daup:
You do not, madam; I perceive they are your mere foils.

Hau:
Then, are you a friend to truth, sir; it makes me love you
the more. It is not the outward, but the inward man that I affect.
They are not apprehensive of an eminent perfection, but love flat,
and dully.

Cen [within.]:
Where are you, my lady Haughty?

Hau:
I come presently, Centaure.—My chamber, sir, my page shall
shew you; and Trusty, my woman, shall be ever awake for you: you
need not fear to communicate any thing with her, for she is a
Fidelia. I pray you wear this jewel for my sake, sir Dauphine.—

[ENTER CENTAURE.]

Where is Mavis, Centaure?

Cen:
Within, madam, a writing. I'll follow you presently:

[EXIT HAU.]

I'll but speak a word with sir Dauphine.

Daup:
With me, madam?

Cen:
Good sir Dauphine, do not trust Haughty, nor make any credit
to her, whatever you do besides. Sir Dauphine, I give you this
caution, she is a perfect courtier, and loves nobody but for her
uses: and for her uses she loves all. Besides, her physicians give
her out to be none o' the clearest, whether she pay them or no,
heaven knows: and she's above fifty too, and pargets! See her in
a forenoon. Here comes Mavis, a worse face then she! you would
not like this, by candle-light.

[RE-ENTER MAVIS.]

If you'll come to my chamber one o' these mornings early, or late
in an evening, I will tell you more. Where's Haughty, Mavis?

Mav:
Within, Centaure.

Cen:
What have you, there?

Mav:
An Italian riddle for sir Dauphine,—you shall not see it
i'faith, Centaure.—

[EXIT CEN.]

Good sir Dauphine, solve it for me. I'll call for it anon.

[EXIT.]

Cler [COMING FORWARD.]:
How now, Dauphine! how dost thou quit
thyself of these females?

Daup:
'Slight, they haunt me like fairies, and give me jewels
here; I cannot be rid of them.

Cler:
O, you must not tell though.

Daup:
Mass, I forgot that: I was never so assaulted. One loves
for virtue, and bribes me with this;
[SHEWS THE JEWEL.]
—another loves me with caution, and so would possess me; a
third brings me a riddle here: and all are jealous: and rail each
at other.

Cler:
A riddle! pray let me see it.
[READS.]
Sir Dauphine, I chose this way of intimation for privacy. The
ladies here, I know, have both hope and purpose to make a
collegiate and servant of you. If I might be so honoured, as to
appear at any end of so noble a work, I would enter into a fame
of taking physic to-morrow, and continue it four or five days,
or longer, for your visitation. Mavis.
By my faith, a subtle one! Call you this a riddle? what's their
plain dealing, trow?

Daup:
We lack Truewit to tell us that.

Cler:
We lack him for somewhat else too: his knights reformadoes
are wound up as high and insolent as ever they were.

Daup:
You jest.

Cler:
No drunkards, either with wine or vanity, ever confess'd
such stories of themselves. I would not give a fly's leg, in
balance against all the womens' reputations here, if they could
be but thought to speak truth: and for the bride, they have made
their affidavit against her directly—

Daup:
What, that they have lain with her?

Cler:
Yes; and tell times and circumstances, with the cause why,
and the place where. I had almost brought them to affirm that they
had done it to-day.

Daup:
Not both of them?

Cler:
Yes, faith: with a sooth or two more I had effected it.
They would have set it down under their hands.

Daup:
Why, they will be our sport, I see, still, whether we will
or no.

[ENTER TRUEWIT.]

True:
O, are you here? Come, Dauphine; go call your uncle
presently: I have fitted my divine, and my canonist, dyed
their beards and all. The knaves do not know themselves, they
are so exalted and altered. Preferment changes any man. Thou
shalt keep one door and I another, and then Clerimont in the
midst, that he may have no means of escape from their cavilling,
when they grow hot once again. And then the women, as I have
given the bride her instructions, to break in upon him in the
l'enuoy. O, 'twill be full and twanging! Away! fetch him.

[EXIT DAUPHINE.]

[ENTER OTTER DISGUISED AS A DIVINE, AND CUTBEARD AS A CANON LAWYER.]

Come, master doctor, and master parson, look to your parts now,
and discharge them bravely: you are well set forth, perform it
as well. If you chance to be out, do not confess it with standing
still, or humming, or gaping one at another: but go on, and talk
aloud and eagerly; use vehement action, and only remember your
terms, and you are safe. Let the matter go where it will: you
have many will do so. But at first be very solemn, and grave like
your garments, though you loose your selves after, and skip out
like a brace of jugglers on a table. Here he comes: set your
faces, and look superciliously, while I present you.

[RE-ENTER DAUPHINE WITH MOROSE.]

Mor:
Are these the two learned men?

True:
Yes, sir; please you salute them.

Mor:
Salute them! I had rather do any thing, than wear out time so
unfruitfully, sir. I wonder how these common forms, as God save
you, and You are welcome, are come to be a habit in our lives:
or, I am glad to see you! when I cannot see what the profit can
be of these words, so long as it is no whit better with him whose
affairs are sad and grievous, that he hears this salutation.

True:
'Tis true, sir; we'll go to the matter then.—Gentlemen,
master doctor, and master parson, I have acquainted you
sufficiently with the business for which you are come hither; and
you are not now to inform yourselves in the state of the question,
I know. This is the gentleman who expects your resolution, and
therefore, when you please, begin.

Ott:
Please you, master doctor.

Cut:
Please you, good master parson.

Ott:
I would hear the canon-law speak first.

Cut:
It must give place to positive divinity, sir.

Mor:
Nay, good gentlemen, do not throw me into circumstances. Let
your comforts arrive quickly at me, those that are. Be swift in
affording me my peace, if so I shall hope any. I love not your
disputations, or your court-tumults. And that it be not strange to
you, I will tell you: My father, in my education, was wont to
advise me, that I should always collect and contain my mind, not
suffering it to flow loosely; that I should look to what things
were necessary to the carriage of my life, and what not; embracing
the one and eschewing the other: in short, that I should endear
myself to rest, and avoid turmoil: which now is grown to be
another nature to me. So that I come not to your public pleadings,
or your places of noise; not that I neglect those things that make
for the dignity of the commonwealth: but for the mere avoiding
of clamours and impertinencies of orators, that know not how to be silent. And for the cause of noise, am I now a suitor to you. You
do not know in what a misery I have been exercised this day, what
a torrent of evil! my very house turns round with the tumult! I
dwell in a windmill: The perpetual motion is here, and not at
Eltham.

True:
Well, good master doctor, will you break the ice? master
parson will wade after.

Cut:
Sir, though unworthy, and the weaker, I will presume.

Ott:
'Tis no presumption, domine doctor.

Mor:
Yet again!

Cut:
Your question is, For how many causes a man may have
divortium legitimum, a lawful divorce? First, you must understand
the nature of the word, divorce, a divertendo—

Mor:
No excursions upon words, good doctor, to the question briefly.

Cut:
I answer then, the canon-law affords divorce but in a few
cases; and the principal is in the common case, the adulterous
case: But there are duodecim impedimenta, twelve impediments, as we call them, all which do not dirimere contractum, but irritum
reddere matrimonium, as we say in the canon-law, not take away the bond, but cause a nullity therein.

Mor:
I understood you before: good sir, avoid your impertinency of
translation.

Ott:
He cannot open this too much, sir, by your favour.

Mor:
Yet more!

True:
O, you must give the learned men leave, sir.—To your
impediments, master Doctor.

Cut:
The first is impedimentum erroris.

Ott:
Of which there are several species.

Cut:
Ay, as error personae.

Ott:
If you contract yourself to one person, thinking her another.

Cut:
Then, error fortunae.

Ott:
If she be a begger, and you thought her rich.

Cut:
Then, error qualitatis.

Ott:
If she prove stubborn or head-strong, that you thought
obedient.

Mor:
How! is that, sir, a lawful impediment? One at once, I pray
you gentlemen.

Ott:
Ay, ante copulam, but not post copulam, sir.

Cut:
Master Parson says right. Nec post nuptiarum benedictionem.
It doth indeed but irrita reddere sponsalia, annul the contract:
after marriage it is of no obstancy.

True:
Alas, sir, what a hope are we fallen from by this time!

Cut:
The next is conditio: if you thought her free born, and she
prove a bond-woman, there is impediment of estate and condition.

Ott:
Ay, but, master doctor, those servitudes are sublatae now,
among us Christians.

Cut:
By your favour, master parson—

Ott:
You shall give me leave, master doctor.

Mor:
Nay, gentlemen, quarrel not in that question; it concerns not
my case: pass to the third.

Cut:
Well then, the third is votum: if either party have made a
vow of chastity. But that practice, as master parson said of the
other, is taken away among us, thanks be to discipline. The fourth
is cognatio: if the persons be of kin within the degrees.

Ott:
Ay: do you know what the degrees are, sir?

Mor:
No, nor I care not, sir: they offer me no comfort in the
question, I am sure.

Cut:
But there is a branch of this impediment may, which is
cognatio spiritualis: if you were her godfather, sir, then the
marriage is incestuous.

Ott:
That comment is absurd and superstitious, master doctor: I
cannot endure it. Are we not all brothers and sisters, and as much
akin in that, as godfathers and god-daughters?

Mor:
O me! to end the controversy, I never was a godfather, I
never was a godfather in my life, sir. Pass to the next.

Cut:
The fifth is crimen adulterii; the known case. The sixth,
cultus disparitas, difference of religion: have you ever examined
her, what religion she is of?

Mor:
No, I would rather she were of none, than be put to the
trouble of it!

Ott:
You may have it done for you, sir.

Mor:
By no means, good sir; on to the rest: shall you ever come
to an end, think you?

True:
Yes, he has done half, sir. On, to the rest.—Be patient,
and expect, sir.

Cut:
The seventh is, vis: if it were upon compulsion or force.

Mor:
O no, it was too voluntary, mine; too voluntary.

Cut:
The eight is, ordo; if ever she have taken holy orders.

Ott:
That's supersitious too.

Mor:
No matter, master parson: Would she would go into a nunnery
yet.

Cut:
The ninth is, ligamen; if you were bound, sir, to any other
before.

Mor:
I thrust myself too soon into these fetters.

Cut:
The tenth is, publica honestas: which is inchoata quaedam
affinitas.

Ott:
Ay, or affinitas orta ex sponsalibus; and is but leve
impedimentum.

Mor:
I feel no air of comfort blowing to me, in all this.

Cut:
The eleventh is, affinitas ex fornicatione.

Ott:
Which is no less vera affinitas, than the other, master
doctor.

Cut:
True, quae oritur ex legitimo matrimonio.

Ott:
You say right, venerable doctor: and, nascitur ex eo, quod
per conjugium duae personae efficiuntur una caro—

Mor:
Hey-day, now they begin!

Cut:
I conceive you, master parson: ita per fornicationem aeque
est verus pater, qui sic generat—

Ott:
Et vere filius qui sic generatur—

Mor:
What's all this to me?

Cler:
Now it grows warm.

Cut:
The twelfth, and last is, si forte coire nequibis.

Ott:
Ay, that is impedimentum gravissimum: it doth utterly annul,
and annihilate, that. If you have manifestam frigiditatem, you
are well, sir.

True:
Why, there is comfort come at length, sir. Confess yourself
but a man unable, and she will sue to be divorced first.

Ott:
Ay, or if there be morbus perpetuus, et insanabilis; as
paralysis, elephantiasis, or so—

Daup:
O, but frigiditas is the fairer way, gentlemen.

Ott:
You say troth, sir, and as it is in the canon, master
doctor—

Cut:
I conceive you, sir.

Cler:
Before he speaks!

Ott:
That a boy, or child, under years, is not fit for marriage,
because he cannot reddere debitum. So your omnipotentes—

True [ASIDE TO OTT.]:
Your impotentes, you whoreson lobster!

Ott:
Your impotentes, I should say, are minime apti ad
contrahenda matrimonium.

True:
Matrimonium! we shall have most unmatrimonial Latin with
you: matrimonia, and be hang'd.

Daup:
You put them out, man.

Cut:
But then there will arise a doubt, master parson, in our
case, post matrimonium: that frigiditate praeditus—do you
conceive me, sir?

Ott:
Very well, sir.

Cut:
Who cannot uti uxore pro uxore, may habere eam pro sorore.

Ott:
Absurd, absurd, absurd, and merely apostatical!

Cut:
You shall pardon me, master parson, I can prove it.

Ott:
You can prove a will, master doctor, you can prove nothing
else. Does not the verse of your own canon say,
Haec socianda vetant connubia, facta retractant?

Cut:
I grant you; but how do they retractare, master parson?

Mor:
O, this was it I feared.

Ott:
In aeternum, sir.

Cut:
That's false in divinity, by your favour.

Ott:
'Tis false in humanity to say so. Is he not prorsus inutilis
ad thorum? Can he praestare fidem datam? I would fain know.

Cut:
Yes; how if he do convalere?

Ott:
He cannot convalere, it is impossible.

True:
Nay, good sir, attend the learned men, they will think you
neglect them else.

Cut:
Or, if he do simulare himself frigidum, odio uxoris, or so?

Ott:
I say, he is adulter manifestus then.

Daup:
They dispute it very learnedly, i'faith.

Ott:
And prostitutor uxoris; and this is positive.

Mor:
Good sir, let me escape.

True:
You will not do me that wrong, sir?

Ott:
And, therefore, if he be manifeste frigidus, sir—

Cut:
Ay, if he be manifeste frigidus, I grant you—

Ott:
Why, that was my conclusion.

Cut:
And mine too.

True:
Nay, hear the conclusion, sir.

Ott:
Then, frigiditatis causa—

Cut:
Yes, causa frigiditatis—

Mor:
O, mine ears!

Ott:
She may have libellum divortii against you.

Cut:
Ay, divortii libellum she will sure have.

Mor:
Good echoes, forbear.

Ott:
If you confess it.

Cut:
Which I would do, sir—

Mor:
I will do any thing.

Ott:
And clear myself in foro conscientiae—

Cut:
Because you want indeed—

Mor:
Yet more?

Ott:
Exercendi potestate.

[EPICOENE RUSHES IN, FOLLOWED BY HAUGHTY, CENTAURE, MAVIS, MISTRESS OTTER, DAW, AND LA-FOOLE.]

Epi:
I will not endure it any longer. Ladies, I beseech you,
help me. This is such a wrong as never was offered to poor
bride before: upon her marriage day, to have her husband
conspire against her, and a couple of mercenary companions
to be brought in for form's sake, to persuade a separation!
If you had blood or virtue in you, gentlemen, you would not
suffer such ear-wigs about a husband, or scorpions to creep
between man and wife.

Mor:
O the variety and changes of my torment!

Hau:
Let them be cudgell'd out of doors, by our grooms.

Cen:
I'll lend you my foot-man.

Mav:
We'll have our men blanket them in the hall.

Mrs. Ott:
As there was one at our house, madam, for peeping
in at the door.

Daw:
Content, i'faith.

True:
Stay, ladies and gentlemen; you'll hear, before you proceed?

Mav:
I'd have the bridegroom blanketted too.

Cen:
Begin with him first.

Hau:
Yes, by my troth.

Mor:
O mankind generation!

Daup:
Ladies, for my sake forbear.

Hau:
Yes, for sir Dauphine's sake.

Cen:
He shall command us.

La-F:
He is as fine a gentleman of his inches, madam, as any
is about the town, and wears as good colours when he lists.

True:
Be brief, sir, and confess your infirmity, she'll be a-fire
to be quit of you, if she but hear that named once, you shall not
entreat her to stay: she'll fly you like one that had the marks
upon him.

Mor:
Ladies, I must crave all your pardons—

True:
Silence, ladies.

Mor:
For a wrong I have done to your whole sex, in marrying this
fair, and virtuous gentlewoman—

Cler:
Hear him, good ladies.

Mor:
Being guilty of an infirmity, which, before I conferred
with these learned men, I thought I might have concealed—

True:
But now being better informed in his conscience by them,
he is to declare it, and give satisfaction, by asking your public
forgiveness.

Mor:
I am no man, ladies.

All:
How!

Mor:
Utterly unabled in nature, by reason of frigidity, to
perform the duties, or any the least office of a husband.

Mav:
Now out upon him, prodigious creature!

Cen:
Bridegroom uncarnate!

Hau:
And would you offer it to a young gentlewoman?

Mrs. Ott:
A lady of her longings?

Epi:
Tut, a device, a device, this, it smells rankly, ladies.
A mere comment of his own.

True:
Why, if you suspect that, ladies, you may have him
search'd—

Daw:
As the custom is, by a jury of physicians.

La-F:
Yes faith, 'twill be brave.

Mor:
O me, must I undergo that?

Mrs. Ott:
No, let women search him, madam: we can do it
ourselves.

Mor:
Out on me! worse.

Epi:
No, ladies, you shall not need, I will take him with all
his faults.

Mor:
Worst of all!

Cler:
Why then, 'tis no divorce, doctor, if she consent not?

Cut:
No, if the man be frigidus, it is de parte uxoris, that we
grant libellum divortii, in the law.

Ott:
Ay, it is the same in theology.

Mor:
Worse, worse than worst!

True:
Nay, sir, be not utterly disheartened; we have yet a
small relic of hope left, as near as our comfort is blown
out. Clerimont, produce your brace of knights. What was that,
master parson, you told me in errore qualitatis, e'en now?—
[ASIDE.]
Dauphine, whisper the bride, that she carry it as if she were
guilty, and ashamed.

Ott:
Marry, sir, in errore qualitatis (which master doctor did
forbear to urge,) if she be found corrupta, that is, vitiated or
broken up, that was pro virgine desponsa, espoused for a maid—

Mor:
What then, sir?

Ott:
It doth dirimere contractum, and irritum reddere too.

True:
If this be true, we are happy again, sir, once more. Here
are an honourable brace of knights, that shall affirm so much.

Daw:
Pardon us, good master Clerimont.

La-F:
You shall excuse us, master Clerimont.

Cler:
Nay, you must make it good now, knights, there is no remedy;
I'll eat no words for you, nor no men: you know you spoke it to
me.

Daw:
Is this gentleman-like, sir?

True [ASIDE TO DAW.]:
Jack Daw, he's worse then sir Amorous;
fiercer a great deal.
[ASIDE TO LA-FOOLE.]—Sir Amorous, beware, there be ten Daws in
this Clerimont.

La-F:
I'll confess it, sir.

Daw:
Will you, sir Amorous, will you wound reputation?

La-F:
I am resolved.

True:
So should you be too, Jack Daw: what should keep you off?
she's but a woman, and in disgrace: he'll be glad on't.

Daw:
Will he? I thought he would have been angry.

Cler:
You will dispatch, knights, it must be done, i'faith.

True:
Why, an it must, it shall, sir, they say: they'll ne'er
go back.
[ASIDE TO THEM.]
—Do not tempt his patience.

Daw:
It is true indeed, sir?

La-F:
Yes, I assure you, sir.

Mor:
What is true gentlemen? what do you assure me?

Daw:
That we have known your bride, sir—

La-F:
In good fashion. She was our mistress, or so—

Cler:
Nay, you must be plain, knights, as you were to me.

Ott:
Ay, the question is, if you have carnaliter, or no?

La-F:
Carnaliter! what else, sir?

Ott:
It is enough: a plain nullity.

Epi:
I am undone, I am undone!

Mor:
O, let me worship and adore you, gentlemen!

Epi [WEEPS.]:
I am undone!

Mor:
Yes, to my hand, I thank these knights.
Master parson, let me thank you otherwise. [GIVES HIM MONEY.]

Hau:
And have they confess'd?

Mav:
Now out upon them, informers!

True:
You see what creatures you may bestow your favours
on, madams.

Hau:
I would except against them as beaten knights, wench,
and not good witnesses in law.

Mrs. Ott:
Poor gentlewoman, how she takes it!

Hau:
Be comforted, Morose, I love you the better for't.

Cen:
so do I, I protest.

Cut:
But, gentlemen, you have not known her since matrimonium?

Daw:
Not to-day, master doctor.

La-F:
No, sir, not to-day.

Cut:
Why, then I say, for any act before, the matrimonium is good
and perfect: unless the worshipful bridegroom did precisely,
before witness, demand, if she were virgo ante nuptias.

Epi:
No, that he did not, I assure you, master doctor.

Cut:
If he cannot prove that, it is ratum conjugium,
notwithstanding the premisses. And they do no way impedire. And
this is my sentence, this I pronounce.

Ott:
I am of master doctor's resolution too, sir: if you made
not that demand, ante nuptias.

Mor:
O my heart! wilt thou break? wilt thou break? this is worst
of all worst worsts that hell could have devised! Marry a whore,
and so much noise!

Daup:
Come, I see now plain confederacy in this doctor and this
parson, to abuse a gentleman. You study his affliction. I pray
be gone companions.—And, gentlemen, I begin to suspect you for
having parts with them.—Sir, will it please you hear me?

Mor:
O do not talk to me, take not from me the pleasure of dying
in silence, nephew.

Daup:
Sir, I must speak to you. I have been long your poor
despised kinsman, and many a hard thought has strengthened
you against me: but now it shall appear if either I love you
or your peace, and prefer them to all the world beside. I will
not be long or grievous to you, sir. If I free you of this
unhappy match absolutely, and instantly, after all this
trouble, and almost in your despair, now—

Mor:
It cannot be.

Daup:
Sir, that you be never troubled with a murmur of it more,
what shall I hope for, or deserve of you?

Mor:
O, what thou wilt, nephew! thou shalt deserve me, and have
me.

Daup:
Shall I have your favour perfect to me, and love hereafter?

Mor:
That, and any thing beside. Make thine own conditions. My
whole estate is thine; manage it, I will become thy ward.

Daup:
Nay, sir, I will not be so unreasonable.

Epi:
Will sir Dauphine be mine enemy too?

Daup:
You know I have been long a suitor to you, uncle, that
out of your estate, which is fifteen hundred a-year, you
would allow me but five hundred during life, and assure the
rest upon me after: to which I have often, by myself and
friends tendered you a writing to sign, which you would never
consent or incline to. If you please but to effect it now—

Mor:
Thou shalt have it, nephew: I will do it, and more.

Daup:
If I quit you not presently, and for ever of this
cumber, you shall have power instantly, afore all these, to
revoke your act, and I will become whose slave you will give
me to, for ever.

Mor:
Where is the writing? I will seal to it, that, or to a
blank, and write thine own conditions.

Epi:
O me, most unfortunate, wretched gentlewoman!

Hau:
Will sir Dauphine do this?

Epi:
Good sir, have some compassion on me.

Mor:
O, my nephew knows you, belike; away, crocodile!

Hau:
He does it not sure without good ground.

Daup:
Here, sir. [GIVES HIM THE PARCHMENTS.]

Mor:
Come, nephew, give me the pen. I will subscribe to any
thing, and seal to what thou wilt, for my deliverance. Thou
art my restorer. Here, I deliver it thee as my deed. If there
be a word in it lacking, or writ with false orthography, I
protest before [heaven] I will not take the advantage.
[RETURNS THE WRITINGS.]

Daup:
Then here is your release, sir.
[TAKES OFF EPICOENE'S PERUKE AND OTHER DISGUISES.]
You have married a boy, a gentleman's son, that I have
brought up this half year at my great charges, and for this
composition, which I have now made with you.—What say you,
master doctor? This is justum impedimentum, I hope, error
personae?

Ott:
Yes sir, in primo gradu.

Cut:
In primo gradu.

Daup:
I thank you, good doctor Cutbeard, and parson Otter.
[PULLS THEIR FALSE BEARDS AND GOWNS OFF.]
You are beholden to them, sir, that have taken this pains for
you; and my friend, master Truewit, who enabled them for the
business. Now you may go in and rest; be as private as you
will, sir.

[EXIT MOROSE.]

I'll not trouble you, till you trouble me with your funeral,
which I care not how soon it come.
—Cutbeard, I'll make your lease good. ""Thank me not, but with
your leg, Cutbeard."" And Tom Otter, your princess shall be
reconciled to you.—How now, gentlemen, do you look at me?

CLER:
A boy!

Daup:
Yes, mistress Epicoene.

True:
Well, Dauphine, you have lurch'd your friends of the
better half of the garland, by concealing this part of the
plot: but much good do it thee, thou deserv'st it, lad. And,
Clerimont, for thy unexpected bringing these two to
confession, wear my part of it freely. Nay, sir Daw, and sir
La-Foole, you see the gentlewoman that has done you the
favours! we are all thankful to you, and so should the
woman-kind here, specially for lying on her, though not
with her! you meant so, I am sure? But that we have stuck it
upon you to-day, in your own imagined persons, and so lately,
this Amazon, the champion of the sex, should beat you now
thriftily, for the common slanders which ladies receive from
such cuckoos as you are. You are they that, when no merit or
fortune can make you hope to enjoy their bodies, will yet
lie with their reputations, and make their fame suffer. Away,
you common moths of these, and all ladies' honours. Go,
travel to make legs and faces, and come home with some new
matter to be laugh'd at: you deserve to live in an air as
corrupted as that wherewith you feed rumour.

[EXEUNT DAW AND LA-FOOLE.]

Madams, you are mute, upon this new metamorphosis! But here
stands she that has vindicated your fames. Take heed of such
insectae hereafter. And let it not trouble you, that you
have discovered any mysteries to this young gentleman: he is
almost of years, and will make a good visitant within this
twelvemonth. In the mean time, we'll all undertake for his
secrecy, that can speak so well of his silence.

[COMING FORWARD.]

—Spectators, if you like this comedy, rise cheerfully, and
now Morose is gone in, clap your hands. It may be, that noise
will cure him, at least please him.

Begin!

Bronze by gold, miss Douce's head by miss Kennedy's head, over the crossblind of the Ormond bar heard the viceregal hoofs go by, ringing steel.

—Is that her? asked miss Kennedy.

Miss Douce said yes, sitting with his ex, pearl grey and eau de Nil.
—Exquisite contrast, miss Kennedy said.

When all agog miss Douce said eagerly:

—Look at the fellow in the tall silk.

—Who? Where? gold asked more eagerly.

—In the second carriage, miss Douce's wet lips said, laughing in the sun.

He's looking. Mind till I see.

She darted, bronze, to the backmost corner, flattening her face against the pane in a halo of hurried breath.

Her wet lips tittered:

—He's killed looking back.

She laughed:

—O wept! Aren't men frightful idiots?

With sadness.

Miss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair behind an ear. Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a hair.

Sadly she twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear.

—It's them has the fine times, sadly then she said.

A man.
Bloowho went by by Moulang's pipes bearing in his breast the sweets of sin, by Wine's antiques, in memory bearing sweet sinful words, by Carroll's dusky battered plate, for Raoul.
The boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came. For them unheeding him he banged on the counter his tray of chattering china. And

—There's your teas, he said.

Miss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned lithia crate, safe from eyes, low.

—What is it? loud boots unmannerly asked.

—Find out, miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.

—Your beau, is it?

A haughty bronze replied:

—I'll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your impertinent insolence.

—Imperthnthn thnthnthn, bootssnout sniffed rudely, as he retreated as she threatened as he had come.

Bloom.

On her flower frowning miss Douce said:

—Most aggravating that young brat is. If he doesn't conduct himself I'll wring his ear for him a yard long.

Ladylike in exquisite contrast.

—Take no notice, miss Kennedy rejoined.

She poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea. They cowered under their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned, waiting for their teas to draw. They pawed their blouses, both of black satin, two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and seven.
Yes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear, hoofs ring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel.

—Am I awfully sunburnt?

Miss bronze unbloused her neck.

—No, said miss Kennedy. It gets brown after. Did you try the borax with the cherry laurel water?

Miss Douce halfstood to see her skin askance in the barmirror gildedlettered where hock and claret glasses shimmered and in their midst a shell.

—And leave it to my hands, she said.

—Try it with the glycerine, miss Kennedy advised.

Bidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce

—Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated. I asked that old fogey in Boyd's for something for my skin.

Miss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed:

—O, don't remind me of him for mercy' sake!

—But wait till I tell you, miss Douce entreated.

Sweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears with little fingers.

—No, don't, she cried.

—I won't listen, she cried.

But Bloom?

Miss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey's tone:

—For your what? says he.

Miss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed again:

—Don't let me think of him or I'll expire. The hideous old wretch! That night in the Antient Concert Rooms.

She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea.

—Here he was, miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters, ruffling her nosewings. Hufa! Hufa!

Shrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy's throat. Miss Douce huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a snout in quest.

—O! shrieking, miss Kennedy cried. Will you ever forget his goggle eye?

Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting:

—And your other eye!

Bloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner's name. Why do I always think Figather? Gathering figs, I think. And Prosper Lore's huguenot name. By Bassi's blessed virgins Bloom's dark eyes went by. Bluerobed, white under, come to me. God they believe she is: or goddess. Those today. I could not see. That fellow spoke. A student. After with Dedalus' son. He might be Mulligan. All comely virgins. That brings those rakes of fellows in: her white.

By went his eyes. The sweets of sin. Sweet are the sweets.

Of sin.

In a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy your other eye. They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other, high piercing notes.

Ah, panting, sighing, sighing, ah, fordone, their mirth died down.

Miss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and gigglegiggled. Miss Douce, bending over the teatray, ruffled again her nose and rolled droll fattened eyes. Again Kennygiggles, stooping, her fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed, spluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter, coughing with choking, crying:

—O greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that! she cried. With his bit of beard!

Douce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman, delight, joy, indignation.

—Married to the greasy nose! she yelled.

Shrill, with deep laughter, after, gold after bronze, they urged each each to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold, goldbronze, shrilldeep, to laughter after laughter. And then laughed more. Greasy I knows. Exhausted, breathless, their shaken heads they laid, braided and pinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge. All flushed (O!), panting, sweating (O!), all breathless.

Married to Bloom, to greaseabloom.

—O saints above! miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose. I wished

I hadn't laughed so much. I feel all wet.

—O, miss Douce! miss Kennedy protested. You horrid thing!

And flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.

By Cantwell's offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi's virgins, bright of their oils. Nannetti's father hawked those things about, wheedling at doors as I. Religion pays. Must see him for that par. Eat first. I want. Not yet. At four, she said. Time ever passing. Clockhands turning. On. Where eat? The Clarence, Dolphin. On. For Raoul. Eat. If I net five guineas with those ads. The violet silk petticoats. Not yet. The sweets of sin.

Flushed less, still less, goldenly paled.

Into their bar strolled Mr Dedalus. Chips, picking chips off one of his rocky thumbnails. Chips. He strolled.

—O, welcome back, miss Douce.

He held her hand. Enjoyed her holidays?

—Tiptop.

He hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor.

—Gorgeous, she said. Look at the holy show I am. Lying out on the strand all day.

Bronze whiteness.

—That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her and pressed her hand indulgently. Tempting poor simple males.

Miss Douce of satin douced her arm away.

—O go away! she said. You're very simple, I don't think.

He was.

—Well now I am, he mused. I looked so simple in the cradle they christened me simple Simon.

—You must have been a doaty, miss Douce made answer. And what did the doctor order today?

—Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself. I think I'll trouble you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.

Jingle.

—With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.

With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane's she turned herself. With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from her crystal keg. Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought pouch and pipe. Alacrity she served. He blew through the flue two husky fifenotes.

—By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains. Must be a great tonic in the air down there. But a long threatening comes at last, they say. Yes. Yes.

Yes. He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid's, into the bowl. Chips. Shreds. Musing. Mute.

None nought said nothing. Yes.

Gaily miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling:

—O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas!

—Was Mr Lidwell in today?

In came Lenehan. Round him peered Lenehan. Mr Bloom reached Essex bridge. Yes, Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex. To Martha I must write. Buy paper. Daly's. Girl there civil. Bloom. Old Bloom. Blue bloom is on the rye.

—He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said.

Lenehan came forward.

—Was Mr Boylan looking for me?

He asked. She answered:

—Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?

She asked. Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her gaze upon a page:

—No. He was not.

Miss gaze of Kennedy, heard, not seen, read on. Lenehan round the sandwichbell wound his round body round.

—Peep! Who's in the corner?

No glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures. To mind her stops. To read only the black ones: round o and crooked ess.

Jingle jaunty jingle.

Girlgold she read and did not glance. Take no notice. She took no notice while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly:

—Ah fox met ah stork. Said thee fox too thee stork: Will you put your bill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone?

He droned in vain. Miss Douce turned to her tea aside.

He sighed aside:

—Ah me! O my!

He greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.

—Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.

—Who may he be? Mr Dedalus asked.

Lenehan opened most genial arms. Who?

—Who may he be? he asked. Can you ask? Stephen, the youthful bard.

Dry.

Mr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe.

—I see, he said. I didn't recognise him for the moment. I hear he is keeping very select company. Have you seen him lately?

He had.

—I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan. In Mooney's en ville and in Mooney's sur mer. He had received the rhino for the labour of his muse.

He smiled at bronze's teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes:

—The élite of Erin hung upon his lips. The ponderous pundit, Hugh

MacHugh, Dublin's most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel boy of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of the O'Madden Burke.

After an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and

—That must have been highly diverting, said he. I see.

He see. He drank. With faraway mourning mountain eye. Set down his glass.

He looked towards the saloon door.

—I see you have moved the piano.

—The tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking concert and I never heard such an exquisite player.

—Is that a fact?

—Didn't he, miss Kennedy? The real classical, you know. And blind too, poor fellow. Not twenty I'm sure he was.

—Is that a fact? Mr Dedalus said.

He drank and strayed away.

—So sad to look at his face, miss Douce condoled.

God's curse on bitch's bastard.

Tink to her pity cried a diner's bell. To the door of the bar and diningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of Ormond. Lager for diner. Lager without alacrity she served.

With patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for jinglejaunty blazes boy.

Upholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the oblique triple (piano!) wires. He pressed (the same who pressed indulgently her hand), soft pedalling, a triple of keys to see the thicknesses of felt advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in action.

Two sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was in Wisdom Hely's wise Bloom in Daly's Henry Flower bought. Are you not happy in your home? Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo. Means something, language of flow. Was it a daisy? Innocence that is. Respectable girl meet after mass. Thanks awfully muchly. Wise Bloom eyed on the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves. Smoke mermaids, coolest whiff of all. Hair streaming: lovelorn. For some man. For Raoul. He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat riding on a jaunting car. It is. Again. Third time. Coincidence.

Jingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay. Follow. Risk it. Go quick. At four. Near now. Out.

—Twopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say.

—Aha... I was forgetting... Excuse...

—And four.

At four she. Winsomely she on Bloohimwhom smiled. Bloo smi qui go. Ternoon. Think you're the only pebble on the beach? Does that to all.

For men.

In drowsy silence gold bent on her page.

From the saloon a call came, long in dying. That was a tuningfork the tuner had that he forgot that he now struck. A call again. That he now poised that it now throbbed. You hear? It throbbed, pure, purer, softly and softlier, its buzzing prongs. Longer in dying call.

Pat paid for diner's popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray and popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with miss

Douce.

—The bright stars fade...

A voiceless song sang from within, singing:

—... the morn is breaking.

A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive hands. Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording, called to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love's leavetaking, life's, love's morn.

—The dewdrops pearl...

Lenehan's lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy.

—But look this way, he said, rose of Castile.

Jingle jaunted by the curb and stopped.

She rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile: fretted, forlorn, dreamily rose.

—Did she fall or was she pushed? he asked her.

She answered, slighting:

—Ask no questions and you'll hear no lies.

Like lady, ladylike.

Blazes Boylan's smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he strode. Yes, gold from anear by bronze from afar. Lenehan heard and knew and hailed him:

—See the conquering hero comes.

Between the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered hero. See me he might. The seat he sat on: warm. Black wary hecat walked towards Richie Goulding's legal bag, lifted aloft, saluting.

—And I from thee...

—I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.

He touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw. She smiled on him. But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer hair, a bosom and a rose.

Smart Boylan bespoke potions.

—What's your cry? Glass of bitter? Glass of bitter, please, and a sloegin for me. Wire in yet?

Not yet. At four she. Who said four?

Cowley's red lugs and bulging apple in the door of the sheriff's office.

Avoid. Goulding a chance. What is he doing in the Ormond? Car waiting.

Wait.

Hello. Where off to? Something to eat? I too was just. In here. What, Ormond? Best value in Dublin. Is that so? Diningroom. Sit tight there. See, not be seen. I think I'll join you. Come on. Richie led on. Bloom followed bag. Dinner fit for a prince.

Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her bust, that all but burst, so high.

—O! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch. O!
But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.

—Why don't you grow? asked Blazes Boylan.

Shebronze, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his lips, looked as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), and syrupped with her voice:

—Fine goods in small parcels.

That is to say she. Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe.

—Here's fortune, Blazes said.

He pitched a broad coin down. Coin rang.

—Hold on, said Lenehan, till I...

—Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale.

—Sceptre will win in a canter, he said.

—I plunged a bit, said Boylan winking and drinking. Not on my own, you know. Fancy of a friend of mine.

Lenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at miss Douce's lips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled.

Idolores. The eastern seas.

Clock whirred. Miss Kennedy passed their way (flower, wonder who gave), bearing away teatray. Clock clacked.

Miss Douce took Boylan's coin, struck boldly the cashregister. It clanged. Clock clacked. Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till and hummed and handed coins in change. Look to the west. A clack. For me.

—What time is that? asked Blazes Boylan. Four?

O'clock.

Lenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged Blazes Boylan's elbowsleeve.

—Let's hear the time, he said.

The bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered tables. Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table near the door. Be near. At four. Has he forgotten? Perhaps a trick. Not come: whet appetite. I couldn't do. Wait, wait. Pat, waiter, waited.

Sparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure's skyblue bow and eyes.

—Go on, pressed Lenehan. There's no-one. He never heard.

—... to Flora's lips did hie.

High, a high note pealed in the treble clear.

Bronzedouce communing with her rose that sank and rose sought

Blazes Boylan's flower and eyes.

—Please, please.

He pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.

—I could not leave thee...

—Afterwits, miss Douce promised coyly.

—No, now, urged Lenehan. Sonnezlacloche! O do! There's no-one.

She looked. Quick. Miss Kenn out of earshot. Sudden bent. Two kindling faces watched her bend.

Quavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord, and lost and found it, faltering.

—Go on! Do! Sonnez!

Bending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee. Delayed. Taunted them still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes.

—Sonnez!

Smack. She set free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter smackwarm against her smackable a woman's warmhosed thigh.

—La Cloche! cried gleeful Lenehan. Trained by owner. No sawdust there.

She smilesmirked supercilious (wept! aren't men?), but, lightward gliding, mild she smiled on Boylan.

—You're the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said.

Boylan, eyed, eyed. Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his chalice tiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops. His spellbound eyes went after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by mirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses shimmering, a spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with sunnier bronze.

Yes, bronze from anearby.

—... Sweetheart, goodbye!

—I'm off, said Boylan with impatience.

He slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.

—Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly. I wanted to tell you.

Tom Rochford...

—Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.

Lenehan gulped to go.

—Got the horn or what? he said. Wait. I'm coming.

He followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the threshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.

—How do you do, Mr Dollard?

—Eh? How do? How do? Ben Dollard's vague bass answered, turning an instant from Father Cowley's woe. He won't give you any trouble, Bob. Alf Bergan will speak to the long fellow. We'll put a barleystraw in that Judas Iscariot's ear this time.

Sighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an eyelid.

—Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily. Come on, Simon. Give us a ditty. We heard the piano.

Bald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders. Power for Richie. And Bloom? Let me see. Not make him walk twice. His corns. Four now. How warm this black is. Course nerves a bit. Refracts (is it?) heat. Let me see. Cider. Yes, bottle of cider.

—What's that? Mr Dedalus said. I was only vamping, man.

—Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called. Begone dull care. Come, Bob.

He ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the: hold him now) into the saloon. He plumped him Dollard on the stool. His gouty paws plumped chords. Plumped, stopped abrupt.

Bald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning. Bothered, he wanted Power and cider. Bronze by the window, watched, bronze from afar.

Jingle a tinkle jaunted.

Bloom heard a jing, a little sound. He's off. Light sob of breath Bloom sighed on the silent bluehued flowers. Jingling. He's gone. Jingle. Hear.

—Love and War, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. God be with old times.

Miss Douce's brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind, smitten by sunlight. Gone. Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting light), she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord. She drew down pensive (why did he go so quick when I?) about her bronze, over the bar where bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast inexquisite nonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of shadow, eau de Nil.

—Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded them. There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the Collard grand.

There was.

—A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said. The devil wouldn't stop him. He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.

—God, do you remember? Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the punished keyboard. And by Japers I had no wedding garment.

They laughed all three. He had no wed. All trio laughed. No wedding garment.

—Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said. Where's my pipe, by the way?

He wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe. Bald Pat carried two diners' drinks, Richie and Poldy. And Father Cowley laughed again.

—I saved the situation, Ben, I think.

—You did, averred Ben Dollard. I remember those tight trousers too. That was a brilliant idea, Bob.

Father Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes. He saved the situa. Tight trou. Brilliant ide.

—I knew he was on the rocks, he said. The wife was playing the piano in the coffee palace on Saturdays for a very trifling consideration and who was it gave me the wheeze she was doing the other business? Do you remember? We had to search all Holles street to find them till the chap in Keogh's gave us the number. Remember? Ben remembered, his broad visage wondering.

—By God, she had some luxurious operacloaks and things there.

Mr Dedalus wandered back, pipe in hand.

—Merrion square style. Balldresses, by God, and court dresses. He wouldn't take any money either. What? Any God's quantity of cocked hats and boleros and trunkhose. What?

—Ay, ay, Mr Dedalus nodded. Mrs Marion Bloom has left off clothes of all descriptions.

Jingle jaunted down the quays. Blazes sprawled on bounding tyres.

Liver and bacon. Steak and kidney pie. Right, sir. Right, Pat.

Mrs Marion. Met him pike hoses. Smell of burn. Of Paul de Kock. Nice name he.

—What's this her name was? A buxom lassy. Marion...

—Tweedy.

—Yes. Is she alive?

—And kicking.

—She was a daughter of...

—Daughter of the regiment.

—Yes, begad. I remember the old drummajor.

Mr Dedalus struck, whizzed, lit, puffed savoury puff after

—Irish? I don't know, faith. Is she, Simon?

Puff after stiff, a puff, strong, savoury, crackling.

—Buccinator muscle is... What?... Bit rusty... O, she is... My Irish Molly, O.

He puffed a pungent plumy blast.

—From the rock of Gibraltar... all the way.

They pined in depth of ocean shadow, gold by the beerpull, bronze by maraschino, thoughtful all two. Mina Kennedy, 4 Lismore terrace, Drumcondra with Idolores, a queen, Dolores, silent.

Pat served, uncovered dishes. Leopold cut liverslices. As said before he ate with relish the inner organs, nutty gizzards, fried cods' roes while Richie Goulding, Collis, Ward ate steak and kidney, steak then kidney, bite by bite of pie he ate Bloom ate they ate.

Bloom with Goulding, married in silence, ate. Dinners fit for princes.

By Bachelor's walk jogjaunty jingled Blazes Boylan, bachelor, in sun in heat, mare's glossy rump atrot, with flick of whip, on bounding tyres: sprawled, warmseated, Boylan impatience, ardentbold. Horn. Have you the? Horn. Have you the? Haw haw horn.

Over their voices Dollard bassooned attack, booming over bombarding chords:

—When love absorbs my ardent soul...

Roll of Bensoulbenjamin rolled to the quivery loveshivery roofpanes.

—War! War! cried Father Cowley. You're the warrior.

—So I am, Ben Warrior laughed. I was thinking of your landlord. Love or money.

He stopped. He wagged huge beard, huge face over his blunder huge.

—Sure, you'd burst the tympanum of her ear, man, Mr Dedalus said through smoke aroma, with an organ like yours.

In bearded abundant laughter Dollard shook upon the keyboard. He would.

—Not to mention another membrane, Father Cowley added. Half time, Ben. Amoroso ma non troppo. Let me there.

Miss Kennedy served two gentlemen with tankards of cool stout. She passed a remark. It was indeed, first gentleman said, beautiful weather. They drank cool stout. Did she know where the lord lieutenant was going? And heard steelhoofs ringhoof ring. No, she couldn't say. But it would be in the paper. O, she need not trouble. No trouble. She waved about her outspread Independent, searching, the lord lieutenant, her pinnacles of hair slowmoving, lord lieuten. Too much trouble, first gentleman said. O, not in the least. Way he looked that. Lord lieutenant. Gold by bronze heard iron steel.

—............ my ardent soul
I care not foror the morrow.

In liver gravy Bloom mashed mashed potatoes. Love and War someone is. Ben Dollard's famous. Night he ran round to us to borrow a dress suit for that concert. Trousers tight as a drum on him. Musical porkers. Molly did laugh when he went out. Threw herself back across the bed, screaming, kicking. With all his belongings on show. O saints above, I'm drenched! O, the women in the front row! O, I never laughed so many! Well, of course that's what gives him the base barreltone. For instance eunuchs. Wonder who's playing. Nice touch. Must be Cowley. Musical. Knows whatever note you play. Bad breath he has, poor chap. Stopped.

Miss Douce, engaging, Lydia Douce, bowed to suave solicitor, George Lidwell, gentleman, entering. Good afternoon. She gave her moist (a lady's) hand to his firm clasp. Afternoon. Yes, she was back. To the old dingdong again.

—Your friends are inside, Mr Lidwell.

George Lidwell, suave, solicited, held a lydiahand.

Bloom ate liv as said before. Clean here at least. That chap in the Burton, gummy with gristle. No-one here: Goulding and I. Clean tables, flowers, mitres of napkins. Pat to and fro. Bald Pat. Nothing to do. Best value in Dub.

Piano again. Cowley it is. Way he sits in to it, like one together, mutual understanding. Tiresome shapers scraping fiddles, eye on the bowend, sawing the cello, remind you of toothache. Her high long snore. Night we were in the box. Trombone under blowing like a grampus, between the acts, other brass chap unscrewing, emptying spittle. Conductor's legs too, bagstrousers, jiggedy jiggedy. Do right to hide them.

Jiggedy jingle jaunty jaunty.

Only the harp. Lovely. Gold glowering light. Girl touched it. Poop of a lovely. Gravy's rather good fit for a. Golden ship. Erin. The harp that once or twice. Cool hands. Ben Howth, the rhododendrons. We are their harps. I. He. Old. Young.

—Ah, I couldn't, man, Mr Dedalus said, shy, listless.

Strongly.

—Go on, blast you! Ben Dollard growled. Get it out in bits.

—M'appari, Simon, Father Cowley said.

Down stage he strode some paces, grave, tall in affliction, his long arms outheld. Hoarsely the apple of his throat hoarsed softly. Softly he sang to a dusty seascape there: A Last Farewell. A headland, a ship, a sail upon the billows. Farewell. A lovely girl, her veil awave upon the wind upon the headland, wind around her.

Cowley sang:

—M'appari tutt'amor:
Il mio sguardo l'incontr...

She waved, unhearing Cowley, her veil, to one departing, dear one, to wind, love, speeding sail, return.

—Go on, Simon.

—Ah, sure, my dancing days are done, Ben... Well...

Mr Dedalus laid his pipe to rest beside the tuningfork and, sitting, touched the obedient keys.

—No, Simon, Father Cowley turned. Play it in the original. One flat.

The keys, obedient, rose higher, told, faltered, confessed, confused.

Up stage strode Father Cowley.

—Here, Simon, I'll accompany you, he said. Get up.

By Graham Lemon's pineapple rock, by Elvery's elephant jingly jogged. Steak, kidney, liver, mashed, at meat fit for princes sat princes Bloom and Goulding. Princes at meat they raised and drank, Power and cider.

Most beautiful tenor air ever written, Richie said: Sonnambula. He heard Joe Maas sing that one night. Ah, what M'Guckin! Yes. In his way. Choirboy style. Maas was the boy. Massboy. A lyrical tenor if you like. Never forget it. Never.

Tenderly Bloom over liverless bacon saw the tightened features strain. Backache he. Bright's bright eye. Next item on the programme. Paying the piper. Pills, pounded bread, worth a guinea a box. Stave it off awhile. Sings too: Down among the dead men. Appropriate. Kidney pie. Sweets to the. Not making much hand of it. Best value in. Characteristic of him. Power. Particular about his drink. Flaw in the glass, fresh Vartry water. Fecking matches from counters to save. Then squander a sovereign in dribs and drabs. And when he's wanted not a farthing. Screwed refusing to pay his fare. Curious types.

Never would Richie forget that night. As long as he lived: never. In the gods of the old Royal with little Peake. And when the first note.

Speech paused on Richie's lips.

Coming out with a whopper now. Rhapsodies about damn all.

Believes his own lies. Does really. Wonderful liar. But want a good memory.

—Which air is that? asked Leopold Bloom.

—All is lost now.

Richie cocked his lips apout. A low incipient note sweet banshee murmured: all. A thrush. A throstle. His breath, birdsweet, good teeth he's proud of, fluted with plaintive woe. Is lost. Rich sound. Two notes in one there. Blackbird I heard in the hawthorn valley. Taking my motives he twined and turned them. All most too new call is lost in all. Echo. How sweet the answer. How is that done? All lost now. Mournful he whistled. Fall, surrender, lost.

Bloom bent leopold ear, turning a fringe of doyley down under the vase. Order. Yes, I remember. Lovely air. In sleep she went to him. Innocence in the moon. Brave. Don't know their danger. Still hold her back. Call name. Touch water. Jingle jaunty. Too late. She longed to go. That's why. Woman. As easy stop the sea. Yes: all is lost.

—A beautiful air, said Bloom lost Leopold. I know it well.

Never in all his life had Richie Goulding.

He knows it well too. Or he feels. Still harping on his daughter. Wise child that knows her father, Dedalus said. Me?

Bloom askance over liverless saw. Face of the all is lost. Rollicking Richie once. Jokes old stale now. Wagging his ear. Napkinring in his eye. Now begging letters he sends his son with. Crosseyed Walter sir I did sir. Wouldn't trouble only I was expecting some money. Apologise.

Piano again. Sounds better than last time I heard. Tuned probably. Stopped again.

Dollard and Cowley still urged the lingering singer out with it.

—With it, Simon.

—It, Simon.

—Ladies and gentlemen, I am most deeply obliged by your kind solicitations.

—It, Simon.

—I have no money but if you will lend me your attention I shall endeavour to sing to you of a heart bowed down.

By the sandwichbell in screening shadow Lydia, her bronze and rose, a lady's grace, gave and withheld: as in cool glaucous eau de Nil Mina to tankards two her pinnacles of gold.

The harping chords of prelude closed. A chord, longdrawn, expectant, drew a voice away.

—When first I saw that form endearing...

Richie turned.

—Si Dedalus' voice, he said.

Braintipped, cheek touched with flame, they listened feeling that flow endearing flow over skin limbs human heart soul spine. Bloom signed to Pat, bald Pat is a waiter hard of hearing, to set ajar the door of the bar. The door of the bar. So. That will do. Pat, waiter, waited, waiting to hear, for he was hard of hear by the door.

—Sorrow from me seemed to depart.

Through the hush of air a voice sang to them, low, not rain, not leaves in murmur, like no voice of strings or reeds or whatdoyoucallthem dulcimers touching their still ears with words, still hearts of their each his remembered lives. Good, good to hear: sorrow from them each seemed to from both depart when first they heard. When first they saw, lost Richie Poldy, mercy of beauty, heard from a person wouldn't expect it in the least, her first merciful lovesoft oftloved word.

Love that is singing: love's old sweet song. Bloom unwound slowly the elastic band of his packet. Love's old sweet sonnez la gold. Bloom wound a skein round four forkfingers, stretched it, relaxed, and wound it round his troubled double, fourfold, in octave, gyved them fast.

—Full of hope and all delighted...

Tenors get women by the score. Increase their flow. Throw flower at his feet. When will we meet? My head it simply. Jingle all delighted. He can't sing for tall hats. Your head it simply swurls. Perfumed for him. What perfume does your wife? I want to know. Jing. Stop. Knock. Last look at mirror always before she answers the door. The hall. There? How do you? I do well. There? What? Or? Phial of cachous, kissing comfits, in her satchel. Yes? Hands felt for the opulent.

Alas the voice rose, sighing, changed: loud, full, shining, proud.

—But alas, 'twas idle dreaming...

Glorious tone he has still. Cork air softer also their brogue. Silly man! Could have made oceans of money. Singing wrong words. Wore out his wife: now sings. But hard to tell. Only the two themselves. If he doesn't break down. Keep a trot for the avenue. His hands and feet sing too. Drink. Nerves overstrung. Must be abstemious to sing. Jenny Lind soup: stock, sage, raw eggs, half pint of cream. For creamy dreamy.

Tenderness it welled: slow, swelling, full it throbbed. That's the chat. Ha, give! Take! Throb, a throb, a pulsing proud erect.

Words? Music? No: it's what's behind.

Bloom looped, unlooped, noded, disnoded.

Bloom. Flood of warm jamjam lickitup secretness flowed to flow in music out, in desire, dark to lick flow invading. Tipping her tepping her tapping her topping her. Tup. Pores to dilate dilating. Tup. The joy the feel the warm the. Tup. To pour o'er sluices pouring gushes. Flood, gush, flow, joygush, tupthrob. Now! Language of love.

—... ray of hope is...

Beaming. Lydia for Lidwell squeak scarcely hear so ladylike the muse unsqueaked a ray of hopk.

Martha it is. Coincidence. Just going to write. Lionel's song. Lovely name you have. Can't write. Accept my little pres. Play on her heartstrings pursestrings too. She's a. I called you naughty boy. Still the name: Martha. How strange! Today.

The voice of Lionel returned, weaker but unwearied. It sang again to Richie Poldy Lydia Lidwell also sang to Pat open mouth ear waiting to wait. How first he saw that form endearing, how sorrow seemed to part, how look, form, word charmed him Gould Lidwell, won Pat Bloom's heart.

Wish I could see his face, though. Explain better. Why the barber in Drago's always looked my face when I spoke his face in the glass. Still hear it better here than in the bar though farther.

—Each graceful look...

First night when first I saw her at Mat Dillon's in Terenure. Yellow, black lace she wore. Musical chairs. We two the last. Fate. After her. Fate.

Round and round slow. Quick round. We two. All looked. Halt. Down she sat. All ousted looked. Lips laughing. Yellow knees.

—Charmed my eye...

Singing. Waiting she sang. I turned her music. Full voice of perfume of what perfume does your lilactrees. Bosom I saw, both full, throat warbling. First I saw. She thanked me. Why did she me? Fate. Spanishy eyes. Under a peartree alone patio this hour in old Madrid one side in shadow Dolores shedolores. At me. Luring. Ah, alluring.

—Martha! Ah, Martha!

Quitting all languor Lionel cried in grief, in cry of passion dominant to love to return with deepening yet with rising chords of harmony. In cry of lionel loneliness that she should know, must martha feel. For only her he waited. Where? Here there try there here all try where. Somewhere.

—Co-ome, thou lost one!
Co-ome, thou dear one!

Alone. One love. One hope. One comfort me. Martha, chestnote, return!

—Come!

It soared, a bird, it held its flight, a swift pure cry, soar silver orb it leaped serene, speeding, sustained, to come, don't spin it out too long long breath he breath long life, soaring high, high resplendent, aflame, crowned, high in the effulgence symbolistic, high, of the etherial bosom, high, of the high vast irradiation everywhere all soaring all around about the all, the endlessnessnessness...

—To me!

Siopold!

Consumed.

Come. Well sung. All clapped. She ought to. Come. To me, to him, to her, you too, me, us.

—Bravo! Clapclap. Good man, Simon. Clappyclapclap. Encore! Clapclipclap clap. Sound as a bell. Bravo, Simon! Clapclopclap. Encore, enclap, said, cried, clapped all, Ben Dollard, Lydia Douce, George Lidwell, Pat, Mina Kennedy, two gentlemen with two tankards, Cowley, first gent with tank and bronze miss Douce and gold MJiss Mina.

Blazes Boylan's smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor, said before. Jingle by monuments of sir John Gray, Horatio onehandled Nelson, reverend father Theobald Mathew, jaunted, as said before just now. Atrot, in heat, heatseated. Cloche. Sonnez la. Cloche. Sonnez la. Slower the mare went up the hill by the Rotunda, Rutland square. Too slow for Boylan, blazes Boylan, impatience Boylan, joggled the mare.

An afterclang of Cowley's chords closed, died on the air made richer.

And Richie Goulding drank his Power and Leopold Bloom his cider drank, Lidwell his Guinness, second gentleman said they would partake of two more tankards if she did not mind. Miss Kennedy smirked, disserving, coral lips, at first, at second. She did not mind.

—Seven days in jail, Ben Dollard said, on bread and water. Then you'd sing, Simon, like a garden thrush.

Lionel Simon, singer, laughed. Father Bob Cowley played. Mina Kennedy served. Second gentleman paid. Tom Kernan strutted in. Lydia, admired, admired. But Bloom sang dumb.

Admiring.

Richie, admiring, descanted on that man's glorious voice. He remembered one night long ago. Never forget that night. Si sang 'Twas rank and fame: in Ned Lambert's 'twas. Good God he never heard in all his life a note like that he never did then false one we had better part so clear so God he never heard since love lives not a clinking voice lives not ask Lambert he can tell you too.

Goulding, a flush struggling in his pale, told Mr Bloom, face of the night, Si in Ned Lambert's, Dedalus house, sang 'Twas rank and fame.

He, Mr Bloom, listened while he, Richie Goulding, told him, Mr Bloom, of the night he, Richie, heard him, Si Dedalus, sing 'TWAS RANK AND FAME in his, Ned Lambert's, house.

Brothers-in-law: relations. We never speak as we pass by. Rift in the lute I think. Treats him with scorn. See. He admires him all the more. The night Si sang. The human voice, two tiny silky chords, wonderful, more than all others.

That voice was a lamentation. Calmer now. It's in the silence after you feel you hear. Vibrations. Now silent air.

Bloom ungyved his crisscrossed hands and with slack fingers plucked the slender catgut thong. He drew and plucked. It buzz, it twanged. While Goulding talked of Barraclough's voice production, while Tom Kernan, harking back in a retrospective sort of arrangement talked to listening Father Cowley, who played a voluntary, who nodded as he played. While big Ben Dollard talked with Simon Dedalus, lighting, who nodded as he smoked, who smoked.

Thou lost one. All songs on that theme. Yet more Bloom stretched his string. Cruel it seems. Let people get fond of each other: lure them on. Then tear asunder. Death. Explos. Knock on the head. Outtohelloutofthat. Human life. Dignam. Ugh, that rat's tail wriggling! Five bob I gave. Corpus paradisum. Corncrake croaker: belly like a poisoned pup. Gone. They sing. Forgotten. I too; And one day she with. Leave her: get tired. Suffer then. Snivel. Big spanishy eyes goggling at nothing. Her wavyavyeavyheavyeavyevyevyhair un comb:'d.

Yet too much happy bores. He stretched more, more. Are you not happy in your? Twang. It snapped.

Jingle into Dorset street.

Miss Douce withdrew her satiny arm, reproachful, pleased.

—Don't make half so free, said she, till we are better acquainted.

George Lidwell told her really and truly: but she did not believe.

First gentleman told Mina that was so. She asked him was that so. And second tankard told her so. That that was so.

Miss Douce, miss Lydia, did not believe: miss Kennedy, Mina, did not believe: George Lidwell, no: miss Dou did not: the first, the first: gent with the tank: believe, no, no: did not, miss Kenn: Lidlydiawell: the tank.

Better write it here. Quills in the postoffice chewed and twisted.

Bald Pat at a sign drew nigh. A pen and ink. He went. A pad. He went. A pad to blot. He heard, deaf Pat.

—Yes, Mr Bloom said, teasing the curling catgut line. It certainly is. Few lines will do. My present. All that Italian florid music is. Who is this wrote? Know the name you know better. Take out sheet notepaper, envelope: unconcerned. It's so characteristic.

—Grandest number in the whole opera, Goulding said.

—It is, Bloom said.

Numbers it is. All music when you come to think. Two multiplied by two divided by half is twice one. Vibrations: chords those are. One plus two plus six is seven. Do anything you like with figures juggling. Always find out this equal to that. Symmetry under a cemetery wall. He doesn't see my mourning. Callous: all for his own gut. Musemathematics. And you think you're listening to the etherial. But suppose you said it like: Martha, seven times nine minus x is thirtyfive thousand. Fall quite flat. It's on account of the sounds it is.

Instance he's playing now. Improvising. Might be what you like, till you hear the words. Want to listen sharp. Hard. Begin all right: then hear chords a bit off: feel lost a bit. In and out of sacks, over barrels, through wirefences, obstacle race. Time makes the tune. Question of mood you're in. Still always nice to hear. Except scales up and down, girls learning. Two together nextdoor neighbours. Ought to invent dummy pianos for that. Blumenlied I bought for her. The name. Playing it slow, a girl, night I came home, the girl. Door of the stables near Cecilia street. Milly no taste. Queer because we both, I mean.

Bald deaf Pat brought quite flat pad ink. Pat set with ink pen quite flat pad. Pat took plate dish knife fork. Pat went.

It was the only language Mr Dedalus said to Ben. He heard them as a boy in Ringabella, Crosshaven, Ringabella, singing their barcaroles. Queenstown harbour full of Italian ships. Walking, you know, Ben, in the moonlight with those earthquake hats. Blending their voices. God, such music, Ben. Heard as a boy. Cross Ringabella haven mooncarole.

Sour pipe removed he held a shield of hand beside his lips that cooed a moonlight nightcall, clear from anear, a call from afar, replying.

Down the edge of his Freeman baton ranged Bloom's, your other eye, scanning for where did I see that. Callan, Coleman, Dignam Patrick. Heigho! Heigho! Fawcett. Aha! Just I was looking...

Hope he's not looking, cute as a rat. He held unfurled his Freeman. Can't see now. Remember write Greek ees. Bloom dipped, Bloo mur: dear sir. Dear Henry wrote: dear Mady. Got your lett and flow. Hell did I put? Some pock or oth. It is utterl imposs. Underline imposs. To write today.

Bore this. Bored Bloom tambourined gently with I am just reflecting fingers on flat pad Pat brought.

On. Know what I mean. No, change that ee. Accep my poor litt pres enclos. Ask her no answ. Hold on. Five Dig. Two about here. Penny the gulls. Elijah is com. Seven Davy Byrne's. Is eight about. Say half a crown. My poor little pres: p. o. two and six. Write me a long. Do you despise? Jingle, have you the? So excited. Why do you call me naught? You naughty too? O, Mairy lost the string of her. Bye for today. Yes, yes, will tell you. Want to. To keep it up. Call me that other. Other world she wrote. My patience are exhaust. To keep it up. You must believe. Believe. The tank. It. Is. True.

Folly am I writing? Husbands don't. That's marriage does, their wives. Because I'm away from. Suppose. But how? She must. Keep young. If she found out. Card in my high grade ha. No, not tell all. Useless pain. If they don't see. Woman. Sauce for the gander.

A hackney car, number three hundred and twentyfour, driver Barton James of number one Harmony avenue, Donnybrook, on which sat a fare, a young gentleman, stylishly dressed in an indigoblue serge suit made by George Robert Mesias, tailor and cutter, of number five Eden quay, and wearing a straw hat very dressy, bought of John Plasto of number one Great Brunswick street, hatter. Eh? This is the jingle that joggled and jingled. By Dlugacz' porkshop bright tubes of Agendath trotted a gallantbuttocked mare.

—Answering an ad? keen Richie's eyes asked Bloom.

—Yes, Mr Bloom said. Town traveller. Nothing doing, I expect.

Bloom mur: best references. But Henry wrote: it will excite me. You know how. In haste. Henry. Greek ee. Better add postscript. What is he playing now? Improvising. Intermezzo. P. S. The rum tum tum. How will you pun? You punish me? Crooked skirt swinging, whack by. Tell me I want to. Know. O. Course if I didn't I wouldn't ask. La la la ree. Trails off there sad in minor. Why minor sad? Sign H. They like sad tail at end. P. P. S. La la la ree. I feel so sad today. La ree. So lonely. Dee.

He blotted quick on pad of Pat. Envel. Address. Just copy out of paper. Murmured: Messrs Callan, Coleman and Co, limited. Henry wrote:

Miss Martha Clifford c/o P. O. Dolphin's Barn Lane Dublin

Blot over the other so he can't read. There. Right. Idea prize titbit. Something detective read off blottingpad. Payment at the rate of guinea per col. Matcham often thinks the laughing witch. Poor Mrs Purefoy. U. P: up.

Too poetical that about the sad. Music did that. Music hath charms. Shakespeare said. Quotations every day in the year. To be or not to be. Wisdom while you wait.

In Gerard's rosery of Fetter lane he walks, greyedauburn. One life is all. One body. Do. But do.

Done anyhow. Postal order, stamp. Postoffice lower down. Walk now. Enough. Barney Kiernan's I promised to meet them. Dislike that job.

House of mourning. Walk. Pat! Doesn't hear. Deaf beetle he is.

Car near there now. Talk. Talk. Pat! Doesn't. Settling those napkins. Lot of ground he must cover in the day. Paint face behind on him then he'd be two. Wish they'd sing more. Keep my mind off.

Bald Pat who is bothered mitred the napkins. Pat is a waiter hard of his hearing. Pat is a waiter who waits while you wait. Hee hee hee hee. He waits while you wait. Hee hee. A waiter is he. Hee hee hee hee. He waits while you wait. While you wait if you wait he will wait while you wait. Hee hee hee hee. Hoh. Wait while you wait.

Douce now. Douce Lydia. Bronze and rose.

She had a gorgeous, simply gorgeous, time. And look at the lovely shell she brought.

To the end of the bar to him she bore lightly the spiked and winding seahorn that he, George Lidwell, solicitor, might hear.

—Listen! she bade him.

Under Tom Kernan's ginhot words the accompanist wove music slow. Authentic fact. How Walter Bapty lost his voice. Well, sir, the husband took him by the throat. Scoundrel, said he, You'll sing no more lovesongs. He did, faith, sir Tom. Bob Cowley wove. Tenors get wom. Cowley lay back.

Ah, now he heard, she holding it to his ear. Hear! He heard.

Wonderful. She held it to her own. And through the sifted light pale gold in contrast glided. To hear.

Tap.

Bloom through the bardoor saw a shell held at their ears. He heard more faintly that that they heard, each for herself alone, then each for other, hearing the plash of waves, loudly, a silent roar.

Bronze by a weary gold, anear, afar, they listened.

Her ear too is a shell, the peeping lobe there. Been to the seaside. Lovely seaside girls. Skin tanned raw. Should have put on coldcream first make it brown. Buttered toast. O and that lotion mustn't forget. Fever near her mouth. Your head it simply. Hair braided over: shell with seaweed. Why do they hide their ears with seaweed hair? And Turks the mouth, why? Her eyes over the sheet. Yashmak. Find the way in. A cave. No admittance except on business.

The sea they think they hear. Singing. A roar. The blood it is. Souse in the ear sometimes. Well, it's a sea. Corpuscle islands.

Wonderful really. So distinct. Again. George Lidwell held its murmur, hearing: then laid it by, gently.

—What are the wild waves saying? he asked her, smiled.

Charming, seasmiling and unanswering Lydia on Lidwell smiled.

Tap.

By Larry O'Rourke's, by Larry, bold Larry O', Boylan swayed and Boylan turned.

From the forsaken shell miss Mina glided to her tankards waiting. No, she was not so lonely archly miss Douce's head let Mr Lidwell know. Walks in the moonlight by the sea. No, not alone. With whom? She nobly answered: with a gentleman friend.

Bob Cowley's twinkling fingers in the treble played again. The landlord has the prior. A little time. Long John. Big Ben. Lightly he played a light bright tinkling measure for tripping ladies, arch and smiling, and for their gallants, gentlemen friends. One: one, one, one, one, one: two, one, three, four.

Sea, wind, leaves, thunder, waters, cows lowing, the cattlemarket, cocks, hens don't crow, snakes hissss. There's music everywhere. Ruttledge's door: ee creaking. No, that's noise. Minuet of Don Giovanni he's playing now. Court dresses of all descriptions in castle chambers dancing. Misery. Peasants outside. Green starving faces eating dockleaves. Nice that is. Look: look, look, look, look, look: you look at us.

That's joyful I can feel. Never have written it. Why? My joy is other joy. But both are joys. Yes, joy it must be. Mere fact of music shows you are. Often thought she was in the dumps till she began to lilt. Then know.

M'Coy valise. My wife and your wife. Squealing cat. Like tearing silk. Tongue when she talks like the clapper of a bellows. They can't manage men's intervals. Gap in their voices too. Fill me. I'm warm, dark, open. Molly in quis est homo: Mercadante. My ear against the wall to hear. Want a woman who can deliver the goods.

Jog jig jogged stopped. Dandy tan shoe of dandy Boylan socks skyblue clocks came light to earth.

O, look we are so! Chamber music. Could make a kind of pun on that. It is a kind of music I often thought when she. Acoustics that is. Tinkling. Empty vessels make most noise. Because the acoustics, the resonance changes according as the weight of the water is equal to the law of falling water. Like those rhapsodies of Liszt's, Hungarian, gipsyeyed. Pearls. Drops. Rain. Diddleiddle addleaddle ooddleooddle. Hissss. Now. Maybe now. Before.

One rapped on a door, one tapped with a knock, did he knock Paul de Kock with a loud proud knocker with a cock carracarracarra cock. Cockcock.

Tap.

—Qui sdegno, Ben, said Father Cowley.

—No, Ben, Tom Kernan interfered. The Croppy Boy. Our native Doric.

—Ay do, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. Good men and true.

—Do, do, they begged in one.

I'll go. Here, Pat, return. Come. He came, he came, he did not stay. To me. How much?

—What key? Six sharps?

—F sharp major, Ben Dollard said.

Bob Cowley's outstretched talons griped the black deepsounding chords.

Must go prince Bloom told Richie prince. No, Richie said. Yes, must. Got money somewhere. He's on for a razzle backache spree. Much? He seehears lipspeech. One and nine. Penny for yourself. Here. Give him twopence tip. Deaf, bothered. But perhaps he has wife and family waiting, waiting Patty come home. Hee hee hee hee. Deaf wait while they wait.

But wait. But hear. Chords dark. Lugugugubrious. Low. In a cave of the dark middle earth. Embedded ore. Lumpmusic.

The voice of dark age, of unlove, earth's fatigue made grave approach and painful, come from afar, from hoary mountains, called on good men and true. The priest he sought. With him would he speak a word.

Tap.

Ben Dollard's voice. Base barreltone. Doing his level best to say it. Croak of vast manless moonless womoonless marsh. Other comedown. Big ships' chandler's business he did once. Remember: rosiny ropes, ships' lanterns. Failed to the tune of ten thousand pounds. Now in the Iveagh home. Cubicle number so and so. Number one Bass did that for him.

The priest's at home. A false priest's servant bade him welcome. Step in. The holy father. With bows a traitor servant. Curlycues of chords.

Ruin them. Wreck their lives. Then build them cubicles to end their days in. Hushaby. Lullaby. Die, dog. Little dog, die.

The voice of warning, solemn warning, told them the youth had entered a lonely hall, told them how solemn fell his footsteps there, told them the gloomy chamber, the vested priest sitting to shrive.

Decent soul. Bit addled now. Thinks he'll win in Answers, poets' picture puzzle. We hand you crisp five pound note. Bird sitting hatching in a nest. Lay of the last minstrel he thought it was. See blank tee what domestic animal? Tee dash ar most courageous mariner. Good voice he has still. No eunuch yet with all his belongings.

Listen. Bloom listened. Richie Goulding listened. And by the door deaf Pat, bald Pat, tipped Pat, listened. The chords harped slower.

The voice of penance and of grief came slow, embellished, tremulous. Ben's contrite beard confessed. in nomine Domini, in God's name he knelt. He beat his hand upon his breast, confessing: mea culpa.

Latin again. That holds them like birdlime. Priest with the communion corpus for those women. Chap in the mortuary, coffin or coffey, corpusnomine. Wonder where that rat is by now. Scrape.

Tap.

They listened. Tankards and miss Kennedy. George Lidwell, eyelid well expressive, fullbusted satin. Kernan. Si.

The sighing voice of sorrow sang. His sins. Since Easter he had cursed three times. You bitch's bast. And once at masstime he had gone to play. Once by the churchyard he had passed and for his mother's rest he had not prayed. A boy. A croppy boy.

Bronze, listening, by the beerpull gazed far away. Soulfully. Doesn't half know I'm. Molly great dab at seeing anyone looking.

Bronze gazed far sideways. Mirror there. Is that best side of her face? They always know. Knock at the door. Last tip to titivate.

Cockcarracarra.

What do they think when they hear music? Way to catch rattlesnakes. Night Michael Gunn gave us the box. Tuning up. Shah of Persia liked that best. Remind him of home sweet home. Wiped his nose in curtain too. Custom his country perhaps. That's music too. Not as bad as it sounds. Tootling. Brasses braying asses through uptrunks. Doublebasses helpless, gashes in their sides. Woodwinds mooing cows. Semigrand open crocodile music hath jaws. Woodwind like Goodwin's name.

She looked fine. Her crocus dress she wore lowcut, belongings on show. Clove her breath was always in theatre when she bent to ask a question. Told her what Spinoza says in that book of poor papa's. Hypnotised, listening. Eyes like that. She bent. Chap in dresscircle staring down into her with his operaglass for all he was worth. Beauty of music you must hear twice. Nature woman half a look. God made the country man the tune. Met him pike hoses. Philosophy. O rocks!

All gone. All fallen. At the siege of Ross his father, at Gorey all his brothers fell. To Wexford, we are the boys of Wexford, he would. Last of his name and race.

I too. Last of my race. Milly young student. Well, my fault perhaps. No son. Rudy. Too late now. Or if not? If not? If still?

He bore no hate.

Hate. Love. Those are names. Rudy. Soon I am old. Big Ben his voice unfolded. Great voice Richie Goulding said, a flush struggling in his pale, to Bloom soon old. But when was young?

Ireland comes now. My country above the king. She listens. Who fears to speak of nineteen four? Time to be shoving. Looked enough.

—Bless me, father, Dollard the croppy cried. Bless me and let me go.

Tap.

Bloom looked, unblessed to go. Got up to kill: on eighteen bob a week. Fellows shell out the dibs. Want to keep your weathereye open. Those girls, those lovely. By the sad sea waves. Chorusgirl's romance. Letters read out for breach of promise. From Chickabiddy's owny Mumpsypum. Laughter in court. Henry. I never signed it. The lovely name you.

Low sank the music, air and words. Then hastened. The false priest rustling soldier from his cassock. A yeoman captain. They know it all by heart. The thrill they itch for. Yeoman cap.

Tap. Tap.

Thrilled she listened, bending in sympathy to hear.

Blank face. Virgin should say: or fingered only. Write something on it: page. If not what becomes of them? Decline, despair. Keeps them young. Even admire themselves. See. Play on her. Lip blow. Body of white woman, a flute alive. Blow gentle. Loud. Three holes, all women. Goddess I didn't see. They want it. Not too much polite. That's why he gets them. Gold in your pocket, brass in your face. Say something. Make her hear. With look to look. Songs without words. Molly, that hurdygurdy boy. She knew he meant the monkey was sick. Or because so like the Spanish. Understand animals too that way. Solomon did. Gift of nature.

Ventriloquise. My lips closed. Think in my stom. What?

Will? You? I. Want. You. To.

With hoarse rude fury the yeoman cursed, swelling in apoplectic bitch's bastard. A good thought, boy, to come. One hour's your time to live, your last.

Tap. Tap.

Thrill now. Pity they feel. To wipe away a tear for martyrs that want to, dying to, die. For all things dying, for all things born. Poor Mrs Purefoy. Hope she's over. Because their wombs.

A liquid of womb of woman eyeball gazed under a fence of lashes, calmly, hearing. See real beauty of the eye when she not speaks. On yonder river. At each slow satiny heaving bosom's wave (her heaving embon) red rose rose slowly sank red rose. Heartbeats: her breath: breath that is life. And all the tiny tiny fernfoils trembled of maidenhair.

But look. The bright stars fade. O rose! Castile. The morn. Ha. Lidwell. For him then not for. Infatuated. I like that? See her from here though. Popped corks, splashes of beerfroth, stacks of empties.

On the smooth jutting beerpull laid Lydia hand, lightly, plumply, leave it to my hands. All lost in pity for croppy. Fro, to: to, fro: over the polished knob (she knows his eyes, my eyes, her eyes) her thumb and finger passed in pity: passed, reposed and, gently touching, then slid so smoothly, slowly down, a cool firm white enamel baton protruding through their sliding ring.

With a cock with a carra.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I hold this house. Amen. He gnashed in fury. Traitors swing.

The chords consented. Very sad thing. But had to be. Get out before the end. Thanks, that was heavenly. Where's my hat. Pass by her. Can leave that Freeman. Letter I have. Suppose she were the? No. Walk, walk, walk. Like Cashel Boylo Connoro Coylo Tisdall Maurice Tisntdall Farrell. Waaaaaaalk.

Well, I must be. Are you off? Yrfmstbyes. Blmstup. O'er ryehigh blue. Ow. Bloom stood up. Soap feeling rather sticky behind. Must have sweated: music. That lotion, remember. Well, so long. High grade. Card inside. Yes.

By deaf Pat in the doorway straining ear Bloom passed.

At Geneva barrack that young man died. At Passage was his body laid. Dolor! O, he dolores! The voice of the mournful chanter called to dolorous prayer.

By rose, by satiny bosom, by the fondling hand, by slops, by empties, by popped corks, greeting in going, past eyes and maidenhair, bronze and faint gold in deepseashadow, went Bloom, soft Bloom, I feel so lonely Bloom.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

Pray for him, prayed the bass of Dollard. You who hear in peace. Breathe a prayer, drop a tear, good men, good people. He was the croppy boy.

Scaring eavesdropping boots croppy bootsboy Bloom in the Ormond hallway heard the growls and roars of bravo, fat backslapping, their boots all treading, boots not the boots the boy. General chorus off for a swill to wash it down. Glad I avoided.

—Come on, Ben, Simon Dedalus cried. By God, you're as good as ever you were.

—Better, said Tomgin Kernan. Most trenchant rendition of that ballad, upon my soul and honour It is.

—Lablache, said Father Cowley.

Ben Dollard bulkily cachuchad towards the bar, mightily praisefed and all big roseate, on heavyfooted feet, his gouty fingers nakkering castagnettes in the air.

Big Benaben Dollard. Big Benben. Big Benben.

Rrr.

And deepmoved all, Simon trumping compassion from foghorn nose, all laughing they brought him forth, Ben Dollard, in right good cheer.

—You're looking rubicund, George Lidwell said.

Miss Douce composed her rose to wait.

—Ben machree, said Mr Dedalus, clapping Ben's fat back shoulderblade. Fit as a fiddle only he has a lot of adipose tissue concealed about his person.

Rrrrrrrsss.

—Fat of death, Simon, Ben Dollard growled.

Richie rift in the lute alone sat: Goulding, Collis, Ward. Uncertainly he waited. Unpaid Pat too.

Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.

Miss Mina Kennedy brought near her lips to ear of tankard one.

—Mr Dollard, they murmured low.

—Dollard, murmured tankard.

Tank one believed: miss Kenn when she: that doll he was: she doll: the tank.

He murmured that he knew the name. The name was familiar to him, that is to say. That was to say he had heard the name of. Dollard, was it? Dollard, yes.

Yes, her lips said more loudly, Mr Dollard. He sang that song lovely, murmured Mina. Mr Dollard. And The last rose of summer was a lovely song. Mina loved that song. Tankard loved the song that Mina.

'Tis the last rose of summer dollard left bloom felt wind wound round inside.

Gassy thing that cider: binding too. Wait. Postoffice near Reuben J's one and eightpence too. Get shut of it. Dodge round by Greek street. Wish I hadn't promised to meet. Freer in air. Music. Gets on your nerves. Beerpull. Her hand that rocks the cradle rules the. Ben Howth. That rules the world.

Far. Far. Far. Far.

Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.

Up the quay went Lionelleopold, naughty Henry with letter for Mady, with sweets of sin with frillies for Raoul with met him pike hoses went Poldy on.

Tap blind walked tapping by the tap the curbstone tapping, tap by tap.

Cowley, he stuns himself with it: kind of drunkenness. Better give way only half way the way of a man with a maid. Instance enthusiasts. All ears. Not lose a demisemiquaver. Eyes shut. Head nodding in time. Dotty. You daren't budge. Thinking strictly prohibited. Always talking shop. Fiddlefaddle about notes.

All a kind of attempt to talk. Unpleasant when it stops because you never know exac. Organ in Gardiner street. Old Glynn fifty quid a year. Queer up there in the cockloft, alone, with stops and locks and keys. Seated all day at the organ. Maunder on for hours, talking to himself or the other fellow blowing the bellows. Growl angry, then shriek cursing (want to have wadding or something in his no don't she cried), then all of a soft sudden wee little wee little pipy wind.

Pwee! A wee little wind piped eeee. In Bloom's little wee.

—Was he? Mr Dedalus said, returning with fetched pipe. I was with him this morning at poor little Paddy Dignam's...

—Ay, the Lord have mercy on him.

—By the bye there's a tuningfork in there on the...

Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.

—The wife has a fine voice. Or had. What? Lidwell asked.

—O, that must be the tuner, Lydia said to Simonlionel first I saw, forgot it when he was here.

Blind he was she told George Lidwell second I saw. And played so exquisitely, treat to hear. Exquisite contrast: bronzelid, minagold.

—Shout! Ben Dollard shouted, pouring. Sing out!

—'lldo! cried Father Cowley.

Rrrrrr.

I feel I want...

Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap

—Very, Mr Dedalus said, staring hard at a headless sardine.

Under the sandwichbell lay on a bier of bread one last, one lonely, last sardine of summer. Bloom alone.

—Very, he stared. The lower register, for choice.

Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.

Bloom went by Barry's. Wish I could. Wait. That wonderworker if I had. Twentyfour solicitors in that one house. Counted them. Litigation. Love one another. Piles of parchment. Messrs Pick and Pocket have power of attorney. Goulding, Collis, Ward.

But for example the chap that wallops the big drum. His vocation: Mickey Rooney's band. Wonder how it first struck him. Sitting at home after pig's cheek and cabbage nursing it in the armchair. Rehearsing his band part. Pom. Pompedy. Jolly for the wife. Asses' skins. Welt them through life, then wallop after death. Pom. Wallop. Seems to be what you call yashmak or I mean kismet. Fate.

Tap. Tap. A stripling, blind, with a tapping cane came taptaptapping by Daly's window where a mermaid hair all streaming (but he couldn't see) blew whiffs of a mermaid (blind couldn't), mermaid, coolest whiff of all.

Instruments. A blade of grass, shell of her hands, then blow. Even comb and tissuepaper you can knock a tune out of. Molly in her shift in Lombard street west, hair down. I suppose each kind of trade made its own, don't you see? Hunter with a horn. Haw. Have you the? Cloche. Sonnez la. Shepherd his pipe. Pwee little wee. Policeman a whistle. Locks and keys! Sweep! Four o'clock's all's well! Sleep! All is lost now. Drum? Pompedy. Wait. I know. Towncrier, bumbailiff. Long John. Waken the dead. Pom. Dignam. Poor little nominedomine. Pom. It is music. I mean of course it's all pom pom pom very much what they call da capo. Still you can hear. As we march, we march along, march along. Pom.

I must really. Fff. Now if I did that at a banquet. Just a question of custom shah of Persia. Breathe a prayer, drop a tear. All the same he must have been a bit of a natural not to see it was a yeoman cap. Muffled up. Wonder who was that chap at the grave in the brown macin. O, the whore of the lane!

A frowsy whore with black straw sailor hat askew came glazily in the day along the quay towards Mr Bloom. When first he saw that form endearing? Yes, it is. I feel so lonely. Wet night in the lane. Horn. Who had the? Heehaw shesaw. Off her beat here. What is she? Hope she. Psst! Any chance of your wash. Knew Molly. Had me decked. Stout lady does be with you in the brown costume. Put you off your stroke, that. Appointment we made knowing we'd never, well hardly ever. Too dear too near to home sweet home. Sees me, does she? Looks a fright in the day. Face like dip. Damn her. O, well, she has to live like the rest. Look in here.

In Lionel Marks's antique saleshop window haughty Henry Lionel Leopold dear Henry Flower earnestly Mr Leopold Bloom envisaged battered candlesticks melodeon oozing maggoty blowbags. Bargain: six bob. Might learn to play. Cheap. Let her pass. Course everything is dear if you don't want it. That's what good salesman is. Make you buy what he wants to sell. Chap sold me the Swedish razor he shaved me with. Wanted to charge me for the edge he gave it. She's passing now. Six bob.

Must be the cider or perhaps the burgund.

Near bronze from anear near gold from afar they chinked their clinking glasses all, brighteyed and gallant, before bronze Lydia's tempting last rose of summer, rose of Castile. First Lid, De, Cow, Ker, Doll, a fifth: Lidwell, Si Dedalus, Bob Cowley, Kernan and big Ben Dollard.
Tap. A youth entered a lonely Ormond hall.

Bloom viewed a gallant pictured hero in Lionel Marks's window. Robert Emmet's last words. Seven last words. Of Meyerbeer that is.

—True men like you men.

—Ay, ay, Ben.

—Will lift your glass with us.

They lifted.

Tschink. Tschunk.

Tip. An unseeing stripling stood in the door. He saw not bronze. He saw not gold. Nor Ben nor Bob nor Tom nor Si nor George nor tanks nor Richie nor Pat. Hee hee hee hee. He did not see.

Seabloom, greaseabloom viewed last words. Softly. When my country takes her place among.

Fff! Oo. Rrpr.

Nations of the earth. No-one behind. She's passed. Then and not till then. Tram kran kran kran. Good oppor. Coming. Krandlkrankran. I'm sure it's the burgund. Yes. One, two. Let my epitaph be. Kraaaaaa. Written. I have.

You watched me grow up from a boy
I watched you build from what's destroyed
Rehabbin' houses but held grudges when my mom's house wasn't yours
She had to build somethin' of her own
We disagree on right and wrong
Been on and off communicatin' since the day I left from home

[Pre-Chorus]
And as we get older it's hard to reach understandin'
I left with no Plan ""B"", oh, no
Yeah, I could be all around the world
But without family, it don't mean anything
[Chorus]
Can we bring the love back?
I know that you've been waitin' so long
For it to come home again
Can we bring the love back?
I know that it's been way too long
You've always been home to me, always home

[Verse 2]
I miss you dancin' with a drink in your hand
You got drunk, and never called me again
But you've seen sides that nobody else knows
I need you 'round to see my kids grow old
Patience, these curses on generations
Let's fall back in love and break 'em
Nothing's past a conversation
There's always space for you

Keep those fiction raps
If I come through with the pen that’s a different wap
Man wanna talk about money but I wouldn’t put money on that
Man wanna talk about flows but they know that my ting’s tapped

[Verse 1]
On the A13, coming off at the next exit
Thought that she wanted me, but she just wanted guestlist
When I’m in the booth with Teej, I don’t wanna get no message
Man wanna cat my team, but they can’t run these methods
My newest ting got the best of sauce and you know she’s from west of course
Got a bit of batty and breast of course, she got pee, she can flex of course
She don’t snapchat me and we move low like a packs on me
She loves putting her back on me and she loves ink like Kat Von D
Niggas watch me like obbo, I pick the gear they follow
I been in the booth just getting out more, I got the flow they borrow
Remember when I stopped spitting, had man itching, juice went missing
Then I came back and got vicious when I start switching, my ting’s different
These days 24/7 I run my works
Had a break last week, I met with Shea and we got burst
Hot boxed the whip, went back to the crib and she grabbed my shirt
She was like “what do you wanna take off first?”, I was like blouse and skirt

[Hook]
Yes indeed, I got the recipe
Tempos change but nobody’s been testing me
Blessed indeed, make the beat rest in peace
And life is calm, I ain’t got a girl stressing me

I tell her that ain’t just got any girl, that’s for babygirl, I’m the man love
(Yeah) and I ain’t no dibby dibby rapper
Niggas thinking shit’s sweet because I’m a singy singy rapper
But that’s when it gets ugly, when a man comes through and tries mug me
I been busy with the pen doing fuckery
Blood look at the flick of the wrist trust me
A man got gassed and her wrapped on a track cause I made it look easy
And another man got pissed off ‘cause his girl won’t switch off, I been on repeat
Me and my niggas do equal splits, I ain’t got a brudda being all greedy
If I need something cheeky, I holla at Pep or I holla at Weezy
‘Cause mans a fresh prince like Fresh Prince
Came with the feel like Fresh Prince
Spin an MC like Fresh Prince
You made one hit and been dead since
I do not act all precious, I made one flow and then left it

Either you're noticed or left out
Seven ways to get ahead
Seven reasons to drop round
When I said ""I can see me in your eyes""
You said ""I can see you in my pants""
That's not just friendship that's romance too
You like music we can dance to

Sit me down
Shut me up
I'll calm down
And I'll get along with you

There is a time when we all fail
Some people take it pretty well
Some take it all out on themselves
Others they just take it out on friends
Oh, everybody plays the game
And if you don't you're called insane

Don't, don't, don't, don't, it's not safe no more
I've got to see you one more time
That's when you were born
In 1984

Shut me up
I'll calm down
And I'll get along with you

Everybody was well dressed
And everybody was a mess
Six things without fail you must do
So that your woman loves just you
Oh all the girls played mental games
And all the guys were dressed the same

Why not try it all
If you only remember it once
Oooh ooooooh

Sit me down
Shut me up
I'll calm down
And I'll get along with you

Think my watch is tellin' lies on me
I got here at six

Eu não minto, eu não minto
Me perdi nos olhos dela
Encontrei algo que eu gosto, yeah
Nem era meu tipo
Eu não minto, eu não minto
Nós bebemos a noite toda
Coloquei meu telefone no silencioso
E eu não sеi por que
Não, eu não poderia dеixar ela
Deveria ter dito, ""Tchau, Felicia""
Deve ter sido a tequila
Eu queria que você tivesse amnésia
Venha, venha, o que eu fiz não pode ser desfeito
Beije e persiga, baby, corra, corra
Não dou meu amor pra ninguém (Ninguém)

Você vai tentar, tentar, você não se esqueceu? (Esqueceu)

Então eu levo ela de volta pra isso, de volta pra boate
Bonito, sempre me chame de bonito, então eu pego na mão
Vou fazer birra se você me deixar, é isso
Senhor, não é mentira, quando eu ando em um beat
Eu só tento entregar quando o beat é bom
Acho que nem se importa com o seu homem
Rap bom, mas eu acho que sou um otário
Fode comigo gostoso, depois eu fodo por tanto tempo
Que a lua e o sol trocam de posição, um sumidouro
E eu passo de novo, eu chamo isso de pick roll
Eu tô no topo, não me importo se trocarmos de papéis
Na manhã seguinte, quando sairmos, você pode trocar de roupa
Irritado, você não recebeu meu número quando eu liguei
Muito bom com as palavras, mas eu sou mau com aquele belo golpe
E eu meio que mordo, certo, vadia?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Uh, put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preachin' to the congregation
We love Jesus, but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married, but tonight I need some consummation

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
May the Lord forgive us, may the gods be with us
In that magic hour, I seen good Christians
Make brash decisions, oh, she do it
What happened to religion? Oh, she lose it
She putting on her makeup, she casually allure
Text message break-ups, the casualty of tour
How she gon' wake up and not love me no more?
I thought I was the asshole, I guess it's rubbin' off
Hood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
I'm looking at her like, ""This what you really wanted, huh?""
Why we argue anyway? Oh, I forgot, it's summertime

When the sun go down, it's the magic hour, the magic hour
And outta all the colors that'll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up?
Don't leave while you're hot, that's how Mase screwed up
Throwin' shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat
You see, I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight, you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
That's ""Dior Homme,"" not ""Dior, homie""
The crib Scarface, could it be more Tony?
You love me for me, could you be more phony?
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
Haven't said a word, haven't said a word to me this evening
Cat got your tongue?

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Lookin' at my bitch, I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin' at my wrist, it'll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sipping rosé all alone
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry-red chariot, excess is just my character
All-black tux, nigga's shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired (Uh)
Before his jaw shattered, climbing up the Lord's ladder
We still speedin', running signs like they don't matter, uh
Hater talkin' never made me mad
Never that, not when I'm in my favorite paper tag
Therefore, G4s at the Clearport
When it come to tools, fool, I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope, I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin', so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex' sport
So many cars, DMV thought it was mail fraud
Different traps I was gettin' mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, right in Melbourne
Whole clique appetites had tapeworms
Spinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my J burns
I shed a tear before the night's over
God bless the man I put this ice over (Uh)
Getting 2Pac money twice over
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice-roller
I'm makin' love to the angel of death
Catchin' feelings, never stumble, retracin' my steps (Uh)

Damn
Here we go again
Common passed on this beat, I made it to a jam
Now everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn (Here we go)
Here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Verse 1]
I'll never be picture-perfect, Beyoncé
Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet? He was black as the street was
I'll never be laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people'll reach a
Fake-ass facade that they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up? You see how I played a big
Role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?
I'll never rock a mink coat in the wintertime like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like will.i.am
Let me know if you feel it, man
'Cause everything I'm not made me everything I am

Everything I'm not made me everything I am
[Verse 2]
And I'm back to tear it up
Haters start your engines, I hear 'em gearin' up
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get they hair cut
Okay, fair enough, the streets is flarin' up
'Cause they want gun talk, or I don't wear enough
Baggy clothes, Reeboks, or A-di-dos
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows?
So, say goodbye to the NAACP Award
Goodbye to the India Arie Award
They'd rather give me the Ni-Nigga Please Award
But I'll just take the I Got a Lot of Cheese Award

[Chorus]
Damn
Here we go again
Bum-tu-bum-bum-bum
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
(Here we go) Damn
Here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am
[Verse 3]
I know people wouldn't usually rap this
But I got the facts to back this
Just last year, Chicago had over six hundred caskets
Man, killing's some wack shit
Oh, I forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rappin'
Do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?
He got changed over his chains a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody, pastor
The church want tithe, so I can't afford to pay
Pink slip on my door, 'cause I can't afford to stay
My fifteen seconds up, but I got more to say
That's enough, Mr. West, please, no more today

Hey, Miss Donda
You run into my mama, please tell her I said, ""Say something""
I'm startin' to believe ain't no such thing as Heaven's trumpets
No after-over, this is it, done
If there's a Heaven, you would think they'd let ya speak to your son
Maybe she has in the form of a baby's laugh
I heard passing by in a stroller remindin' me, ""Hey, keep rolling""
I don't know, maybe she has with a prick of a blade of grass
I've been layin' on way too long, got me itchy
Got up and roamed a lil' more
Miss Donda, you see my mama, tell her I'm lost
You see, she'd always light a cigarette, we talk, I would cough
Exaggeratin' a lil' bit so she get the point
Tryna get her to stop smokin', I would leave and fire up a *****
'Til I quit, started back up again, twenty years later
All that time, y'all thought a ***** was high, thought I was crazy
My mom, she ain't cut no corners
Got me back on track, I don't miss her overstepping
But do miss her showin' Seven civilian life ****
Ah, Miss Donda, you see my mama, whisper her this:
The real reason I was geeked to go to church
Must confess, when y'all grown-ups would be in Bible study
That girl helping me with my homework? Her and I were ****
So pure and ****, so spirit spinning and dirty
So on, so on, and so on, we hoped that no one heard us
Sh-sh, ah, ah
And to this day, I think her mama knew but let us explore
Miss Donda, you see my father, please, ask him why he never married
Always smiled, but was he happy inside?
Because I carried my mother's name, did he carry shame with him?
I'm sure she did it out of spite, 'twas her decision at birth
Shit, she probably was hurt, ah, poor baby
Two young people with different views, a lot for a young lady
No coincidence, they both passed away from heart conditions
There's a dissidence at play, dad and mom do hard division
Three Thou', poster child for big **** **** raised by their mothers
I'm supposed to smile as if God knew that I would be troubled
Keeps me around, for what? I don't know
But I do know that it's crucial, that we do so, pronto
I don't know how much long though

Now I live in a new buildin' with amenities
I got a new ceilin' with a chimney
I got a few **** wanna finish me
I don't get too friendly with the enemy
You gotta move different when you in the industry, woo, yeah
You gotta move different when you in the industry, huh

Boy, I got on my feet and I made a name
And I made it a necklace, huh
When you from the bottom and you workin' hard
Just to get to the top, then they gotta respect it
If you got a voice, then you gotta project it
If you got a wrong, then you gotta correct it
If you got a name, then you gotta protect it
If you give me shock, then you gotta electric (Woo)
Tryna live a new life, so I got a new plan that I gotta finesse with (Look, yeah)
'Cause they want me to lose, they ain't part of the Woos

Flexin’ with the business trip
Going cray, take some G6 (Ah)

Take this trip, trip, trip, this, this

Off the grid, grid, grid, grid

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
First, it go viral, then they get digital
Then they get critical, no, I'm not doin' no interview
Mask on my face, you can't see what I'm finna do
Had to move away from people that's miserable
Don't wanna link you, I ain't finna sit with you
Ain't finna talk to you, ain't finna get with you
Don't get me mad 'cause I don't wanna injure you
She put my paintings inside of her living room
Look at the problems and issues I'm livin' through
They tryna drown me, I rise to my pinnacle
Walked through the block like the neighborhood general
Drop me the lo' and then that's where I send it to
I was forgettin' you, now I remember, now I remember
Did what I want and I say what I want
And I thought you was with me, like how you get sensitive?
I got this God power, that's my leverages
I got this Holy Water, that's my beverages
I gotta help myself out of selfishness
I just bought a floor out of Selfridges
I gotta make sure they know who they messin' with
I gotta tell 'em ""sorry,"" they too delicate
I gotta stay with God where the blessings is
I ain't deliverin' Heavenly messages just for the hell of it
Don't try to test me, I keep it clean, but it can get messy
I talk to God every day, that's my bestie
They playin' soccer in my backyard, I think I see Messi
And this money could never neglect me
I pray that my family, they never resent me
And she fell in love with me soon as she met me
We both got a bag but my bag is more heavy
We had to stop countin', it's gettin' too petty
You not a real stepper, you can't overstep me
Just sit back and listen and watch how He bless me
He wait 'til I fall and then pull up and catch me
Your check is too small, you can't run up and check me
Nah, nah, I get 'em fast, see
You feel a way, then go pull up and get me
Might do somethin' wild if I feel like you press me
Nah, I get 'em fast, see
You feel a way, then go pull up and get me
Might do somethin' wild if I feel like you press me
[Chorus: Kanye West]
We off the grid, grid, grid
This for my kid, kid, kid
For when my kid, kid, kids have kids
Everything we did for the crib

[Outro: Kanye West]
Pray for what folks and them did
Only thing we pray God forgive-give-give
May God forbid-bid-bid
He hit one of the kids, kids, kids
Took off His list, list, list
Look what they did, did, did
Pray for the crib, crib, crib
Some say A-A-Adam could never be bla-a-ack

Life change when you famous
I remember, back before the chains, we was nameless
Went through stages just to hop on new stages
Open up your eyes, man, they only entertainers
And I cannot sell my soul (Soul)
And I cannot sell my soul (Soul)
And I cannot sell my soul (Yeah, soul)
And I cannot sell my soul (Jesus saved my soul)
And I cannot sell my soul

[Verse 1: Roddy Ricch, Kanye West & both]
I've been at the top shinin' like a light pole
And I'm just a product of whatever I was raised in
This money sanctified, so I gotta say it again
They said I was mad at the Grammys
But I'm lookin' at my Grammy right now
Pulled up on Ye, and I said, ""They don't understand me""
I just want my dawg to pipe down
'Cause when you really came from the trenches
You was raised in the trenches (Mm)
You feel like you trailblazed for the trenches (Mm)
I hope God can forgive me for the days that I was sinnin' (Mhm)

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch & Kanye West]
The truth is only what you get away with, huh?

Every color Girbauds, every Cutlass is cold
Every cousin that stole, every summer was cold
Out of all of the Moes, out of all of the Folks
After all of the jokes, I'm the one that was chose
All of my friends love to gangbang
How we in my car and you say we ain't in the same lane?
When we both had Pelles on
And we was scammin' for the prom before Chief Keef was ""Bang, Bang""
Always had mob ties
Stood on my six points, how could I not rise?
Love, truth, peace, freedom, justice, but I'm not five

This Southside, and we outside
This Southside, and we outside
This Southside, and we outside
This Southside, and we outside
And for all the guys that went to the White House and said, ""Free the old man""
Every day I put my life on the line to feed the whole clan
Personal worth is not what a person is worth
I can give a dollar to every person on Earth
Man, it's gotta be God's plan
Man, I swear these boys keep playin'

I felt the earth beneath my feet
Sat by the river and it made me complete

So tell me when you're gonna let me in

I felt the branches of it looking at me
Is this the place we used to love?
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?

I am a sinner
Who's prob'ly gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me, Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away, I got
My drink, I got my music, I would share it, but today I'm yellin'
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life, I always
Knew life can be dangerous, I can say that I like a challenge
And you tell me it's painless, you don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hangin' witcha?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar, another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick, I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every makin' of his? Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge, even a small lighter can burn a bridge

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I can feel the changes, I can feel the new people round me
Just wanna be famous, you can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me, that's amazin'

You're tryna keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past ya, we live in a world, we live in a world
On two different axles, you live in a world, you livin' behind
The mirror, I know what you're scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to, this shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain is way more believable
Give me a feasible gain, rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know
This is somethin' you can blame on yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn

[Bridge 2: Bēkon]
God damn you, God damn me
God damn us, God damn we
God damn us all

[Outro: Carl Duckworth]
Verse 2 says, ""You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities""
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse
Because He said He's gonna punish us
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
Are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites, according to the Bible
The children of Israel
He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience
Because we chose to follow other gods
That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee
So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you
Because He loves you, so that's why we get chastised
That's why we're in the position that we're in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments
And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us
We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
Here, in today, in the United States of America
I love you, family, and I pray for you
God bless you

I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit, hol' up
Get it back
I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I could still kill me a nigga, so what?

[Interlude: Anna Wise & Bilal]
If I was the president
I'd pay my mama's rent
Free my homies and them
Bulletproof my Chevy doors
Lay in the White House and get high, Lord
Whoever thought?
Master, take the chains off me!

Life, can be like, a box of chocolate
Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious
Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
Me, scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is
Dream only a dream if work don't follow it
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal
K Dizzle will do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually, you're never charged
But somethin' came over you once I took you to them fuckin' BET Awards
You lookin' at artistses like they're harvestses
So many Rollies around you and you want all of 'em
Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry
I should've listened when my grandmama said to me:

[Chorus: Bilal]
""Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Oh now, slow down""
[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five-foot somethin', God bless the kid
Took his homies to the show and this is what they said:
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
""Fuck am I 'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?
The constant big money talk 'bout the mansion and foreign whips
The private jets and passport, presidential glass floor
Gold bottles, gold models, givin' up the ass for
Instagram flicks, suckin' dick, fuck is this?
One more sucker wavin' with a flashy wrist
My defense mechanism tell me to get him
Quickly because he got it
It's a recession, then why the fuck he at King of Diamonds?
No more livin' poor, meet my four-four
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers
But it's gon' take a lot 'fore this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA
Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?
Well, that's me at these awards""
I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy
She said
[Chorus: Bilal]
""Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Oh now, slow down""

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five-foot something, dazed and confused
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
You can take your boy out the hood
But you can't take the hood out the homie
Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey
Hollywood's nervous
Fuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service220Embed"

Uh, me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
Hit the house lick: tell me, is you wit' it, ya bish? (Ya bish, ya bish)
Home invasion was persuasive (Was persuasive, was persuasive)
From nine to five I know it's vacant, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (Like rappers do, like rappers do)
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool (They wasn't cool, they wasn't cool)
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros (Tell my bros, tell my bros)
Then Usher Raymond ""Let It Burn"" came on (""Let Burn"" came on, ""Let Burn"" came on)
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
Park the car, then we start rhymin', ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
The only thing we had to free our mind (Free our mind, free our mind)
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs (See dollar signs, see dollar signs)
You lookin' like a easy come-up, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
A silver spoon, I know you come from, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew (We never knew, we never knew)
Go at a reverend for the revenue

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustlin' all-day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's jus' how I feel
[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
Nah, nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That's jus' how I feel, nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
That's jus' how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
That's jus' how I feel, nah
A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
That's jus' how I feel

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (Like rappers do, like rappers do)
Bump that new E-40 after school (Way after school, way after school)
You know, ""Big Ballin' With My Homies"" (My homies)
Earl Stevens had us thinkin' rational (Thinkin' rational, that's rational)
Back to reality, we poor, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
Another casualty at war, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head (My Tony head, my Tony head)
He said one day I'll be on tour, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
That Louis Burgers never be the same (Won't be the same, won't be the same)
A Louis belt that never ease that pain (Won't ease that pain, won't ease that pain)
But I'ma purchase when that day is jerkin' (That day is jerkin', that day is jerkin')
Pull off at Church's, with Pirellis skirtin' (Pirellis skirtin', Pirellis skirtin')
Gang signs out the window, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
Hopin' all of 'em offend you, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
They say your hood is a pot o' gold (A pot o' gold, a pot o' gold)
And we gon' crash it when nobody's home

Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!
Love one of you bucket headed hoes? No way!
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way!
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
'Magine Rock up in them projects where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings; liquors spillin', pistols poppin'
Bakin' soda YOLA whippin', ain't no turkey on Thanksgivin'
My homeboy just dome'd a nigga, I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue, every day I'm hustlin'
What else is a thug to do when you eatin' cheese from the government?
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em—get the fuck up out my way, bish!
Got that drum and I got them bands just like a parade, bish!
Drop that work up in the bushes, hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do, tell the truth, this the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut, them serpents lurkin', Blood
Bitches sellin' pussy, niggas sellin' drugs but it's all good
Broken promises, steal your watch and tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a Foot Locker is
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me gettin' shaded under a money tree

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustlin' all-day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's jus' how I feel

Kendrick, just bring my car back, man. I-I called in for another appointment. I figured you weren’t gonna be back here on time anyway. Look, shit, shit, I just wanna get out the house, man. This man is on one. He feelin' good as a motherfucker. Shit, I’m tryna get my thing goin', too. I'm going to Merlin' house. Just bring my car back. Shit, he faded. He feelin' good. Look, listen to him!

Psst, I see dead people
(Mustard on the beat, ho)

[Verse 1]
Ayy, Mustard on the beat, ho
Deebo any rap nigga, he a free throw
Man down, call an amberlamps, tell him, ""Breathe, bro""
Nail a nigga to the cross, he walk around like Teezo
What's up with these jabroni-ass niggas tryna see Compton?
The industry can hate me, fuck 'em all and they mama
How many opps you really got? I mean, it's too many options
I'm finna pass on this body, I'm John Stockton
Beat your ass and hide the Bible if God watchin'
Sometimes you gotta pop out and show niggas
Certified boogeyman, I'm the one that up the score with 'em
Walk him down, whole time, I know he got some ho in him
Pole on him, extort shit, bully Death Row on him
Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young
You better not ever go to cell block one
To any bitch that talk to him and they in love
Just make sure you hide your lil' sister from him
They tell me Chubbs the only one that get your hand-me-downs
And Party at the party playin' with his nose now
And Baka got a weird case, why is he around?
Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, Dot, fuck 'em up
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, I'ma do my stuff
Why you trollin' like a bitch? Ain't you tired?
Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor

You think the Bay gon' let you disrespect Pac, nigga?
I think that Oakland show gon' be your last stop, nigga
Did Cole foul, I don't know why you still pretendin'
What is the owl? Bird niggas and burnt bitches, go
The audience not dumb
Shape the stories how you want, hey, Drake, they're not slow
Rabbit hole is still deep, I can go further, I promise
Ain't that somethin'? B-Rad stands for bitch and you Malibu most wanted
Ain't no law, boy, you ball boy, fetch Gatorade or somethin'
Since 2009, I had this bitch jumpin'
You niggas'll get a wedgie, be flipped over your boxers
What OVO for? The ""Other Vaginal Option""? Pussy
Nigga better straighten they posture, got famous all up in Compton
Might write this for the doctorate, tell the pop star quit hidin'
Fuck a caption, want action, no accident
And I'm hands-on, he fuck around, get polished
Fucked on Wayne girl while he was in jail, that's connivin'
Then get his face tatted like a bitch apologizin'
I'm glad DeRoz' came home, y'all didn't deserve him neither
From Alondra down to Central, nigga better not speak on Serena
And your homeboy need subpoena, that predator move in flocks
That name gotta be registered and placed on neighborhood watch
I lean on you niggas like another line of Wock'
Yeah, it's all eyes on me, and I'ma send it up to Pac, ayy
Put the wrong label on me, I'ma get 'em dropped, ayy
Sweet Chin Music and I won't pass the aux, ayy
How many stocks do I really have in stock? Ayy
One, two, three, four, five, plus five, ayy
Devil is a lie, he a 69 God, ayy
Freaky-ass niggas need to stay they ass inside, ayy
Roll they ass up like a fresh pack of 'za, ayy
City is back up, it's a must, we outside, ayy
[Chorus]
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us

[Verse 3]
Once upon a time, all of us was in chains
Homie still doubled down callin' us some slaves
Atlanta was the Mecca, buildin' railroads and trains
Bear with me for a second, let me put y'all on game
The settlers was usin' townfolk to make 'em richer
Fast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda
You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance
Let me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge
You called Future when you didn't see the club (Ayy, what?)
Lil Baby helped you get your lingo up (What?)
21 gave you false street cred
Thug made you feel like you a slime in your head (Ayy, what?)
Quavo said you can be from Northside (What?)
2 Chainz say you good, but he lied
You run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars
No, you not a colleague, you a fuckin' colonizer
The family matter and the truth of the matter
It was God's plan to show y'all the liar

[Bridge]
Mm
Mm-mm
He a fan, he a fan, he a fan (Mm)

Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life

Let me hear you say, ""OV-ho"" (OV-ho)
Say, ""OV-ho"" (OV-ho)

Love's gonna get you killed
But pride’s gonna be the death of you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me and—

[Chorus: Steve Lacy & Kendrick Lamar]
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care, I care

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldly possessions
Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart, you love ’em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band
I understand I ain't perfect, I probably won't come around
This time I might put you down
Last time I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealin’ with cold thumb
I’m willin' to give up a leg and arm to show empathy from
Pity parties and functions of you and yours
A perfect world, you probably live another 24
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
You might also like[Chorus: Steve Lacy & Kendrick Lamar]
Me, I wasn’t taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care, I care
[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
Maybe I wasn't there (We saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December but never remember what winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world
[Chorus: Steve Lacy & Kendrick Lamar]
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care, I care
[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
Maybe I wasn't there (We saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)

Lord God, I come to you a sinner
And I humbly repent for my sins
I believe that Jesus is Lord
I believe that You raised him from the dead
I would ask that Jesus come to my life
And be my Lord and Savior
I receive Jesus to take control of my life
And that I may live for him from this day forth
Thank you, Lord Jesus, for saving me with your precious blood
In Jesus' name, amen

[Verse]
I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump, from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians, push an '04 Mercedes-Benz
""Hello, my name is Kendrick,"" she said, ""No, you're handsome""
Whispered in my ear, disappeared, then found her dancin'
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearin' shades now, cool
""Where you stay?"" She said, ""Down the street from Dominguez High""
Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount
""Well, is it Compton?"" ""No,"" she replied
Then quickly start battin' her eyes
I strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen with nothin' but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful, ""What you tryna get into?""
She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer, and, well
The summer had passed, and now I'm likin' her
Conversation we havin' probably enticin' her
Who can imagine? Maybe my actions'll end up wifin' her
Love or lust, regardless, we'll fuck 'cause the trife in us
It's deep-rooted, the music of bein' young and dumb
Is never muted, in fact, it's much louder where I'm from
We know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetrius is irrepetible
Family history of gangbangin' did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from gettin' a nut
""I wanna come over, what's up?""
That's what I told her soon as this episode
Of Martin go off, I'm tryna get off
I was in heat like a cactus
My tactics of bein' thirsty probably could hurt me
But fuck it, I got some heart
Grabbed my mama keys, hopped in the car, then, oh boy
So now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passin' Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope, 'cause my pockets broke as a promise, man
I'm thinkin' 'bout that sex
Thinkin' 'bout her thighs or maybe kissin' on her neck or maybe what position's next
Sent a picture of her titties, blowin' up my texts
I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuse
And I'm a professional pornstar when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
I'm hopin' to get her loose like an Uncle Luke anthem
I'm two blocks away, two hundred and fifty feet
And six steps from where she stay, she wavin' me 'cross the street
I pulled up, a smile on my face, and then I see
Two niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang

[Chorus]
When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hopin' that I can borrow
A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck
Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands
My plan's rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back, whispering ""Get 'em!""
I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a youngin
In pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb
Niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop, I hope— [Gunshots]

[Verse 2]
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it Section.80
The message resembled ""Brenda's Got a Baby""
What's crazy was I was hearin' about it
But doubted your ignorance
How could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
Judgin' her past and shit?
Well, it's completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
And I'ma need that forty dollars
Even if I got to fuck, suck and swallow
In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed
By a married man, and father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys
Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em
Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted, but fuck that ""Sorry for your loss"" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait… Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'
I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
You lyin' to these motherfuckers
Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit…
[Chorus]
When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I look in the mirror
And ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away?
If it's today, I hope I hear a
Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'
The scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed
May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about, 'cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak on somethin'
That's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like ""It need to be told""
Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'
Or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's
I count lives, all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in?
[Chorus]
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

Tired of runnin', oh, tired of huntin', oh

Tires are steady screechin', the driver is rubbin', oh
Hands on the wheel, oh, who said we wasn't, oh
Dyin' of thirst, oh, dyin' of thirst, oh, dyin' of thirst, oh?

[Verse 2]
Dope on the corner, oh, look at the coroner, oh
Daughter is dead, oh, mother is mournin' her, oh
Stray bullets, oh, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waitin' patiently, but they couldn't, oh
Bring her back, oh, who got the footage, oh?

How many sins, oh? I'm runnin' out, oh
How many sins, oh? I lost count
Dreams of ballin' like Spalding
But only shotty bounce, oh
The reaper callin', oh, I'm cottonmouth, oh
Money is power (Money is power)
Yours is ours (Yours is ours)
Lay with a snitch, oh, die with a coward, oh
Hope we get rich, oh, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder, oh
The same song, oh, a black flower, oh
I'll show you how to, oh
Dye your thirst, oh, dye your thirst, oh, dye your thirst, oh

[Verse 4]
What are we doin', oh? Who are we foolin', oh?
Hell is hot, oh, fire is proven, oh
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it, oh
Tired of runnin', oh, choirs is hummin', oh
Tell us to visit, oh, we lie about comin', oh
Now back to business, oh, loadin' the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feudin'
The beef is bubblin', oh, it's no discussion, oh
Hereditary, oh, all of my cousins, oh
Dyin' of thirst, oh, dyin' of thirst, oh, dyin' of thirst, oh

[Verse 5]
Too many sins, oh, I'm runnin' out, oh
Somebody send me a well for the drought, oh
See all I know, oh, is takin' notes
On takin' this life for granted, granted, if he provoke, oh
My best days, oh, I stress days
(Lord, forgive me for all my sins, for I not know—)
My best days, oh, I stress days, oh
Say ""fuck the world"", oh, my sex slave, oh
Money, pussy, and greed—what's my next crave?
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave, oh
Tired of runnin', tired of runnin', tired of tumblin'
Tired of runnin', oh, tired of tumblin', backwards
My momma say ""See, a pastor give me a promise
What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished?
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works""
[Skit/Outro]
Fuck! I'm tired of this shit!
I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit!
That’s my brother, homie!
Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?
I know that's not what I think that is
Why are you so angry?
See, you young men are dying of thirst
Do you know what that means?
That means you need water, holy water
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?
Okay, repeat after me:
""Lord God, I come to You a sinner""
(Lord God, I come to You a sinner)
""And I humbly repent for my sins""
(And I humbly repent for my sins)
""I believe that Jesus is Lord""

[Intro]
Everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody sit yo bitch-ass down
And listen to this true mothafuckin' story
Told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans, ya bitch

[Chorus]
Smokin' on the finest dope, ayy-ayy-ayy-ah
Drank until I can't no mo', ayy-ayy-ayy-ah
Really I'm a sober soul
But I'm with the homies right now
And we ain't askin' for no favors
Rush a nigga quick, then laugh about it later, ayy-ayy-ayy-ah
Really, I'm a peacemaker
But I'm with the homies right now
And Momma used to say (Say, say, say, say)
One day it's gon' burn you out (Woo)
One day it's gon' burn you out, out, out
One day it's gon' burn you out (You, you, you, you, you, you)
One day it's gon' burn you
But I'm with the homies right now

Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, an orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales'll roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
'Cause the energy we bringin' sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists that fill they body with hate
If it's necessary; bumpin' Jeezy first album, lookin' distracted
Speakin' language only we know, you think it's an accent
The windows roll down, all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxin' like George Foreman grillin' the masses
Of the workin' world; we pulled up on a bunch of workin' girls
And asked them what they workin' with
Look at me, I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually I'm drug-free, but, shit, I'm with the homies
[Chorus 1]
Yeah, nigga, we off a pill and Rémy Red
Come through and bust ya head, nigga!
Me and the homies
Sag all the way to the liquor store
Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more
Me and the homies
I ride for my mothafuckin' niggas
Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in
Me and the homies
Matter of fact, I hop out that mothafucka
And be like ""doo-doo-doo-doot, doo-doo-doo-doo-doot!”
[Verse 2]
It's 2:30 and the sun is beamin'
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screamin'
Hungry for anything unhealthy
And if nutrition can help me
I'll tell you to suck my dick, then I'll continue eatin'
We speedin' on the 405, passin' Westchester
You know, the light-skinned girls in all the little dresses
Good Lord, they knew we weren't from 'round there
'Cause every time we down there
We pullin' out the Boost Mobile SIM cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like
Then started interrogatin'
I never was a gangbanger, I mean
I never was stranger to the fonk neither, I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
That's ironic, 'cause I've never been violent
Until I'm with the homies

[Chorus 2]
(Just ridin', just ridin')
Me and the homies
(Bullshittin', actin' a fool)
Me and the homies
(Trippin', really trippin')
Me and the homies
(Just ridin', just ridin', just ridin')
[Verse 3]
Braggin' 'bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessy didn't make me feel that bad
I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt ya
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up, even if we ain't got the CD in
But Jeezy still playin'
And our attitude is still ""nigga, what is you sayin'?""
Pull in front of the house
That we been campin' out for like two months
The sun is goin' down as we take whatever we want

[Break]
Ayy, ayy, nigga, jackpot, nigga, pop the safe!
Ayy, nigga, I think there's somebody in this room!
Wait, what?!
Nigga, there's somebody in this room!

[Verse 4]
I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVD's, plasma-screen TV's in the trunk
We made a right, then made a left, then made a right
Then made a left, we was just circlin' life
My mama called: ""Hello? What you doin'?"" — ""Kickin' it.""
I shoulda told her I'm probably 'bout to catch my first offense
With the homies
(Police sirens)
But – they made a right, then made a left
Then made a right, then another right
One lucky night with the homies

[Outro]
K. Dot, you faded, hood?
Yeah, we finally got that nigga faded
I think he hit the wrong blunt though
Ooh, which one?
Well, which one he talkin' about?
I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
I pray he ain't hit that
Nah, that nigga straight, he ain't hit that one
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans!
Nigga, I think we should push back to the city, fo' real doe
Nigga, for what?
What that nigga— what's that Jeezy song say, nigga?
""Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!""
Yeah, yeah, that shit right there
I'm tryna be the nigga in the street
There he go. Man, you don't even know how the shit go
Look, here's the plan, luv
We gon' use the kickback as an alibi, wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park
'Cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight
That's what he's not gon' do
Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30
That's straight, but we should meet up around 12
I'm tryna fuck on somethin' too
Nigga, sit yo dumb-ass back down!
Nigga, you ain't doin' shit tonight!
Matter of fact, nigga, get in the mothafuckin' car!

Aye
New Knucks, they were dying for it
Do a 2 step in my yard to the latest
Always on blast when I played it
That's what I call showing love to my neighbours
Cramp in her leg when I shake it
Bending the back while I'm changing the playlist
She wanna do man to Craig David
But it weren't 7 days that I waited
Now she wanna link up on the Monday
At fashion week, b, I'm doin' up runway
She saw man on the front page
Darkskin darlin' like Yewande
New ting out of Casa Amor
The game is the game, why you mad at me for
They say is it increasing your digits
But it don't count cause I banged it abroad
My next thing in love with the D'usse
We was in the club turning up on a Tuesday
Her friends went around to a new rave
I was getting ex'd off of Brown like Karreuche
Now I'm focused on getting you home
Imma jet in a Bolt, tryna find out what Usain
Sent her home on the Wednesday
Cause she was in the bed tryna hog up the duvet

Did what I like whether right or wrong
I was kinda young, they went out to play, I was writing songs
Back when Craig David had china bumps
The old school whip was a dingers
There's always something weighty inside the trunk
Little man like Kevin, they knew I had Hart
Cause the olders would ask me to Ride Along
Now my tunes is the proof of the work rate
In the studio on Thursday
Make moves before I choose to go her place
Link Jules and get food off of Sergei
Yet another coming by on the Friday
Sleep in my eye but you know I gotta firm it
Stay up, stay up
Shorty wanna deliver the box like Hermes
Or like parcel force to the yard of course
Service a 6/10 but she live out the ends, so I can't endorse
Saturday madness and antics
Find out the plan it can only go one way
More P to collect, but I needed my rest so I slept on the Sunday

Young bull at the top of the block with the white front door and the corner subtle
Cool, but he always in trouble
Why you think his bredrins called him Knuckles?
Ten years old in beef, dad thinks street's takin' over me
Mumsy prayin' for me, but there ain't enough beads on the rosary
Raised by the wolves from young, but still in the jungle like Mowgli
Always up front when the olders speak
So was never as dumb as ones s'posed to
Twos in the spliff by the lift
It be what it be and it is what it is
They said if I tried it, thеy wildin'
And kickin' my shit 'cause it isn't for kids
4th floor's where my ting would'vе lived
If her fam' never moved out to Harrow
Her dad was a pastor and marj was paro
I'd take her daughter off the calm and narrow
Yout with the peppercorn, yeah
I know it seems kinda deep, but they thoughts was shallow
Spent my whole life on the market as the target that they point they arrows
Control it, then I pass it to Paolo
Young kick abouts on Albert Road
Coach said ""Come down to trials""
'Cause I could have got scouted, but I was at home
Or I was outside with the homies
If only I could've advised me now
But even if I was down and out

I'm waved
(No days off)
I'm on a different wave right now though man
Twenty two

[Verse 1]
Yeah
They all tryna find out where my crib at
Man are so fugazi, they fufu lame I ain't with that
It's just vibes, nigga relax
Man have said they married to the game but where the carriage and the ring at?
Must've missed the service, my new tunes flames, man you should turn it
I could turn your set into a furnace
And I could turn 'em vexed I see them burning
Judging like they Judy ask the jury for the verdict
I'm certain
I bet they wish they didn't doubt innit
They can cry me a river, then drown in it
Jiggy with the flow, so I bounce with it
But when I hear the shit you wrote its like a child write it
Alchemist
Three or four donnies passing round a piff
I couldn't count the shit
Was never thinking that my writtens would amount to this
Had to separate my sound from the counterfeit, yo
But they all worried cause we winners
Or probably cause they missing all their suppers and their dinners
They must think I'm monkeys out here running with gorillas
I'm just tryin' make sure I'm comfy all my summers and my winners
Brushing off the splinters
Working like a slave to add some commas to my figures
Struggled to the villas
I don't think I've slept in like two days
Twenty two candles getting lit I need a hip hip and hooray
I told them if they hear this it's too late
A Niggas switching gears new year and a new wave
Black hoodie on like I'm Luke Cage
Bulletproof rap is where it's at cause a Fiasco like Lupe
In my brown leather
I told her we can fly back to mine if it sounds better
Screaming 'ciao bella'
They switch around words to sound clever
I bring a different sound gotta lick 'em down like a brown letter
Man this shits been wild ever since I blew out my last cake
A bunch of 'been a minute's from past mates
The ones I had to beg for them to listen to a thing on my last tape
Now everybody fam like they was given my last name
For real?
They do it for the glamour and the fame
While I was taking notes just to manage the change
I'm the calm before the storm they couldn't handle in the rain
I just thank the Lord I got an extra candle in my cake, ayy

The victim, whose name currently cannot be disclosed
Is now among over 51 young people who have been fatally stabbed in London this year alone
(Nodaysoff)
Last month more than 250 knives and swords were seized—

[Verse 1]
Ayy, made in the manor
I take off my Dsquared² top that I rock and I place on a hanger
Just touched home from the motive, text, ""Get home safely,"" to Anna
I see man have got plenty to say when I'm out
But they never ever say it when the gang are
Can't take man for a spanner
Next time, man, I'm taking a dagger
Now I'm staring at my open door
Marj in the hallway, bawlin' talking 'bout, ""How'm I gettin' home by four?""
Big man at seventeen, can't be stuck at my home no more
Mum sayin' stuff 'bout openin' up but that's what the bros are for
(That’s what the bros are for)

[Chorus]
Man I got hoes some days
And wanna be alone some days
True say I be at home some days
And drillin' with the bros some days (Drillin')
We was on the field and the no go ends
While you're chilling with your mum at home (Home, home, home)
Three man up in a four-door Benz
While you’re chilling with your mum at home (Home, home, home)
Can't you see London's burning?
And you can't duck this smoke (Burn)
Man know 'bout serving
Man know 'bout the pot and stove (Aye, aye, aye)

But true say I never been home (Home, home, home)

Aight, certi, touched at 11:30
Went and stopped at my bredrin's yard, weren't tryna to get there too early
My bredrins say when I drink this hard, then a minor issue will stir me
Then I turned my head and see Anna, with some guy that's moving too thirsty
Like, ""Where did they find this donny?
Ladies man yeah? Think man's funny?
Come we get him wrapped, come and take man's money
Matter of fact mans gonna confront him""
Walked up, pushed him and said, ""What's good?""
Looked at me confused and he said, ""Nothing""
She was like, ""Babes wait stop it""
Weren't gonna ching man, I was just bluffing
But I can't just stand there discussin'
Least not in front of Anna
Gotta come badder
Matter of fact, matter of fact
Where's man's dagger?
What did it drop in the car from my pocket
Nah wait, nah wait, my dog has got it
Then out of the blue
Went and put it in his right hand
Then he dipped my man right in the stomach (Shit)
Now they got man running
On my life, I taste vomit
Ten toes to the Benz, man I ended up throwin' up on the bonnet
Now I hear sirens, while we were tryna zing up the road
Then I looked down and I see bare missed calls
That's mumsy ringing my phone
I shoulda went home

Man I got hoes some days
And wanna be alone some days
True say I be at home some days
And drillin' with the bros some days (Drillin')
We was on the field and the no go ends

I needed this technique to hit a man from like change
(No Days Off)
Waitin', waitin', sat here wastin' my time, just waitin'
In the car parked outside of the station but came with two yutes older than me
I used to like when they tell man stories about all the highs and lows of the street
Who rose? Who fell? Who goes to jail? Who don't and is free?

[Chorus]
""Did you ever hear the story 'bout Leon?""
I said ""Leon?"", they said ""Leon""
He was from the flats that the jack kids be on
Before the cats thеre had the crack to fiend on
Thеy say on the street he a phenom
When he squeeze dons it's phenomenal
Make a change off a name like a hitman
And will hit man if it's reasonable

[Verse 1]
They all have the same reason to call
Oh, what a big misfortune if blank ceases to breathe anymore
Mac on the mantel, teeth in the drawer
If you ask him, he'll call it his callin'
Course he's the one that's receiving the call
If a price on your head in the mornin'
Call money up like there's Ps on the wall
When the payment is set, just need a name and address
A couple pictures never hurt
Man wanna be certain he aimin' correct
A scar on his arm and the nape of the neck
And a big one goin' along the torso
From when the boys tried snake him in west
That calass got repaid in flesh

And will hit man if it's reasonable

[Verse 2]
Logic and reason one thing he prees, every man's got a code
Never hit children or women and don't bring t'ings to your humble abode
He caught most of his bodies alone
Bodies in storage, bodies at home
Feds on the mission to catch man slippin'
By time they sniffin' along, man's ghost
Bro, who do you suppose I could go to and talk 'bout a small little problem?
My problems on Princess Road by the junction
My hunch is he holds, so don't hold any punches
Hold what? Hold where?
Man flung on the all black Airs
Take out a man in his bando and end up wrappin' up all that's theirs

[Chorus]
Did you ever hear the story 'bout Leon?
I said ""Leon?"", they said ""Leon""
He was from the flats that the jack kids be on
Before the cats there had the crack to fiend on
They say on the street he a phenom
When he squeeze dons it's phenomenal
Make a change off a name like a hitman
And will hit man if it's reasonable
[Verse 3]
He come back one evenin', ain't even get 'round to put keys in the door
The ding of the lift when it came to the fifth sent a shiver the kid ain't feelin' before
""What, did they finally found my location?""
""Okay then, mans waitin'""
Donny gradually opened the door, heard the voice say
""Don't move mate, you're goin' to the station""
He always knew one day they would come
Would go out amazin', blazin' his gun
He reached for the piece that he kept on the landin'
But mans wasn't playin', and layed him with one
When the fed tried radio it in, man ran for the first window that was open
He couldn't survive that fall, are you jokin'?
But when he looked out, there was nobody posted

[Chorus]
Did you ever hear the story 'bout Leon?
I said ""Leon?"", they said ""Leon""
He was from the flats that the jack kids be on
Before the cats there had the crack to fiend on
They say on the street he a phenom

I'm takin' they lamb and I'm makin' a banquet (Ayy)
All for the love of the mandem
Know that closed hands never got no plate (No plate)
That's the reason we up all late with V in the T doin' up gourmet
But, but maybe-maybe, I might rock the boat on my Jones like Davy
I might catch a flight to the coast that made me
The diamonds from Naij and the gold's from Haiti
I'm in awe how they all fugazi and yet they're all gazin' at us
Now 5-0 tryna look at us crazy 'cause S went and came in a mask

The first and the very last one at the gym
Spark man at the ring
Say I'm just starting, I beg your pardon
You can't pull a fast one on Mr. Fring
Some say he's the life of the party
For when he pulls up from the party begins
Me and my dawg, yeah partially twins
If you ain't play your part then it can't be a win
Burnt from shows, at my lectures
Holding my head, I was losin' my sleep
How stupid of me
Shit I had to do for this uni degree
I was laid up with a sweet one
I still link her too when I through
She always wanna play with the tree trunks
So why she still in the mood when I leave
Aye, a trick or two in the sleeve
Said I did a couple things that I shouldn't've
The things that I did for thе bunda
I made her my Queen like thе Prince of Zamunda
Pull up and enter the vibe, of course
New shorty on the line, of course
Spend a while when I catch up
I'm still there, cannot find this source
Sorta, kinda, awesome guy but I move kinda wild
When I write these thoughts
Twinkling eye everytime we talk
Tryna keep our replies to be nice and short
Fortune favours the bravest takers, that's why he all day tryna stay locked in
He been working since mum birthed him
And he ain't ever had a day off since

Kofi Stone,It's Ok to Cry,"11 ContributorsIt’s Ok to Cry Lyrics[Verse 1: Kofi Stone]
Boys don’t cry, I ain’t saying that I did
I remember in the summer we were lovers, it was bliss
Both had a lot in common, we was coming from the bits
I would always have a Mars, you would always have a Twix
I know another brother’s probably in the mix
Get your fix, I’ll be getting mine, I tried a second time
A brave face can only last so long
I can’t believe that we let it die, now it’s the present time
And I developed a pressure, I wasn’t gettin mine - it’s bye-bye but never mind my eyes wide for the next bird, the next time
I’ll probably be the bad guy
'Cause good guys never make it to the finish line
Don’t know why I thought to give it time
Cause it only cut me deeper shoulda saw the signs
I still adore you but I love you from a distance
From best friends to strangers we're distant for instance
You don’t write the same amount of kisses in your ""text’es""
Remember when you told me I was different from your exes?
And now you’re probably telling him the same thing
I mean it’s cool but it’s not the same thing
It’s in the past, wish I could erase it
I’m caged in, never been the same since
It’s still a-blaze, wish I could have saved it
A bit of faith, wish we would have made it

[Chorus]
You ain’t gotta be the tough guy all the time
Running from your walls won’t make it alright
It’s ok to cry, sometimes
It’s ok to cry, sometimes

Sometimes I check it just to check you made it home
I crack a smile when I see you ain't alone
Know you need a friend and I've been sittin' on my jones
(Ah, trust) I leave a message at the tone
Probably better if you answered I don't moan (ay)
Then we don't argue, maybe pull me out my zone
'Till you say a couple things about my life I don't condone
(Check) But anyways I'm bumpin' Kanye, hopefully
The bonus track, you know the bitter-sweet poetry
(Trust) I feel like knowing him is knowing me
And knowing you is knowing someone that I hope to be
But yo it's hopeless see?
'Cause I remember when you noticed me
I coulda benched the world over free[?]
Maybe I just never been livin' what I'm supposed to be
'Cause now I'm sittin with this beat, let my soul repeat
But yo before the chorus, appreciate you let me talk
Say I'm sorry, leave my jumpers on the bedroom floor
For all the fuckin' times I'm slammin' on the bedroom door
And all the troubles that I left, they were swept a-shore
But still I wonder why we've really never met before
When I was poor, only worry was the week I saw
'Cause now I'm raw, burnt rotten to the core
I throw away the money for the one that I adore
(Check, to give me more, give me more)

You ain’t gotta be the tough guy all the time

[Verse 3: Kofi Stone]
I've never seen my pops cry
Men ain't really meant to
Prize too high, I was livin' to impress you
Sorry that I stressed you
Never thought I'd get you
Livin' in a mess, I was blessed by your rescue (Check you)
I admit that I checked your page, I couldn't help it
Didn't know the steps to take to move forward
But I seen you doin' well
Boys don't cry - if I did I wouldn't tell
Finger on the dial, I was thinkin' ""Should I bell?""
Everythin' I dreamed, so imagine how I felt
But I wouldn't melt, I'm better by myself
If I never get to heaven 'least I made it through the hell
If crying doesn't help - find a woman like yourself
Left me on the shelf, it's the end of the book
I'm tryna' turn another page but wherever I look
The same story, regardless of the measures I took
So pray for me
Whenever the day's stormy, hopin' you'd wait for me
But knowin' you ain't for me
Wishin' you might call, but this is a cycle
Sick of the white lies and thinkin' it's my fault

Why you want to be like everybody else?
Boy, get your belt
Either that, or I'ma get it for you

You insecure and it don’t make sense
You cute, smart, funny and skilled
I know some people that would kill for your talent
But you tripping over shit we can't afford
This recession time
Better count your blessings, slime
You know how we living
You be eating at your auntie's
She got food up in her kitchen
It won't be this way forever
But right now that's how it is
And if I could get you everything
Shit, I probably would
Then again I wouldn't
'Cause it wouldn't do you good

I wish I had some clean clothes
I wish I had a family that gave a fuck
I wish I had a bed

And they pick you if your grades is up

My sperm donor got out of prison, he back at it
I'm A.D.D., malnutritioned and asthmatic
I'm constantly the target of bullies that have status
And it's overwhelming
But I'm the first one at the school though
And when I have kids they gon' always have the new clothes
When I graduate

Even though I hate my father, put a million on his books

LAUSSE THE CAT,Fuccboi Lullaby,"38 ContributorsFuccboi Lullaby Lyrics[Pre-verse 1: Lausse the Cat]
House party in a Hyde Park road with the Function One's yelling ""guys come over
Front yards in a state, some girls doin’ NOS well away from the heat and the odours
""Name, please""
""Yeah, I'm on plus-one, sir and my mates are too"" so we swerve past the bouncer
Crew splits, some go house, grime heads downstairs and I move to the girl on the counter like
""Hello, ma Cherie, I be off my nut
Got a few beers bubbling about my gut
Like your eyes, hair, thighs, mouth and rounded bumper
Lausse The Cat, you can take my number
Take my hand do a twirl ""gottdamn""
And I swear I ain't never seen as pretty of a girl
Eyes glimmering be looking like pearls
Bit cheesy I know but my sleazy approach won’t work yet...

[Verse 1: Lausse the Cat]
...but you can be my mistress
I'll be your furry assistant
Purpose be serving your thirst ridden wishlist
Cursed to increase all your thoughts hedonistic
A purrve in the sheets see my chirpse your hibiscus
Your ass be my biscuit
'bit egotistic
But gives in the sheets like a service at Christmas
First month free til' I swerve in the distance
And don't ask why it's my terms and conditions""
You might also likeShe looks in his eyes with despise but a hindrance to tell a drunk guy to get lost in an instant
Instead smiles and says ""I admire your wishful thinking what's your name""
I said Lausse The Kitten
And we talked in the kitchen a fable of nonsense
Rushed up the stairs
Hopscotching the long steps
Pranced round the top floor in search of a locked bed
Nix on the keys; tell the boys what went on next

[Pre-verse 2: Lausse the Cat]
And they sexed all month
So I guess you could call it puppy love
And of course kitten kicked in the end
Before the lust turned dry
And as tough as the girl seemed
Cursed she fell with thoughts unsolved
Called the cat but he already had a new girl by his side

[Verse 2: Lausse the Cat]
Sorry my darling
Should have been clearer
L never stays long
He just disappears to
Bodybag hearts for a scarf in the winter
When the spark goes I don't linger
Commenced by lust yet
Trust will desist it
No honey I think it’s best I insist I get
The fuck out of this picture
Don’t cry, don't give a shit
Let a new romance be an elixir
Would you prefer if I left you the morning after
No calls, no talks or laughter
Just sauce and flesh
And shamed walks through parks
And no constant sex from said sex toy
[Pre-verse 3: Lausse the Cat]
Don’t get vexed
Heard love songs sung by a fuccboi
Shouldn't be alarmed if I duck
Oi, don't start slating my name cos' I’m not entertained no more
I made it clear it's a fling
Cos' I don't really wanna
Come to the point where I spunk on your thigh
After 10 minutes straight
Cos' I'm comfy inside
And I bust on your thigh
Cos' we only do it sideways now
Now we're done exploring
We know what excites us
You know what my minds like
I know when you're done soon
Rushed through sex now before bed and never noon
Thrice in the week the excitement done left us now
So I'll say ""yo babe imma cut soon""
""Spoon me""
""Fuck that""
""Don't be a cunt Cat""
""Sorry, imma go bun some hash where my don's at?""
""Right here""
""Yes lad""
""Let's get seshed out""
""Give me a sec with this girl then I'll get back""
Walked to the girl sitting down on her side
Saw him approach, thought he switched up his mind
Flipped her around got the girl upside down
With her neck to the floor (stop) as he distanced her thighs (what are you doing?)
Fisted her ass as he ran past the cervix
Reached to her heart ripped it out with a firm grip
Gulped it in one then the cat disappeared
Left Lucy with one bad heart and her tears4Embed"

I paint my nails black
I dye my hair a darker shade of brown
'Cause you like your women Spanish
Dark, strong and proud
I paint the sky black
You said if you could have your way
You'd make a nighttime all today
So it'd suit the mood of your soul

Oh, what can I do?
Nothing, my sparrow blue

Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you

I paint the house black
My wedding dress black leather, too
You have no room for light
Love is lost on you
I keep my lips red
To seem like cherries in the spring
Darling, you can't let everything
Seem so dark blue

Cuts on his face 'cause he fought too hard

For the things that they hold dear
To forget the things they fear

Lisandra,Songs for Women,"14 ContributorsMERCYCTE // The House on Mango Street LyricsThe House On Mango Street.

We didn't always live on Mango street. Before that we lived on Loomis on the third floor and before that we lived on Keeler. Before Keeler it was Paulina, and before that I can't remember. But what I remember most is moving a lot. Each time it seemed there'd be one more of us. By the time we got to Mango Street we were six--Mama, Papa, Carlos, Kiki, my sister Nenny and me.
The house on Mango Street is ours, and we don't have to pay rent to anybody, or share the yard with the people down stairs, or be careful not to make too much noise, and there isn't a landlord banging on the ceiling with a broom. But even so, it's not the house we'd thought we'd get.
We had to leave the flat on Loomis quick. The water pipes broke and the landlord wouldn't fix them because the house was too old. We had to leave fast. We were using the washroom next door and carrying water over in empty milk gallons. That's why Mama and Papa looked for a house, and that's why we moved into the house on Mango Street, far away, on the other side of town.
They always told us that one day we would move into a house, a real that would be ours for always so we wouldn't have to move each year. And our house would have running water and pipes that worked. And inside it would have real stairs, not hallway stairs, but stairs inside like the house on T.V.And we'd have a basement and at least three washrooms so when we took a bath we wouldn't have to tell everybody. Our house would be white with trees around it, a great big yard and grass growing without a fence. This was the house Papa talked about when he held a lottery ticket and this was the house mama dreamed up in the stories she told us before we went to bed.
But the house on Mango street is not the way they told it at all. It's small and red with tight steps in front and windows so small you'd think they were holding their breath. Bricks are crumbling in places, and the front door is so swollen you have to push hard to get in. There is no front yard, only four little elms the city planted by the curb. Out back is a small garage for the car we don't own yet and a small yard that looks smaller between the two buildings on either side. There are stairs, and the house has only one washroom. Everybody has to share a bedroom--Mama and Papa, Carlos and Kiki, me and Nenny.
Once when we were living on Loomis, a nun from my school passed by and saw m playing out front. The laundromat downstairs had been boarded up because it had been robbed two days before and the owner has painted on the wood YES WE'RE OPEN so as not to lose business.

Where do you live? she asked.
There, I said pointing up to the third floor
You live there?

There. I had to look to where she pointed--the third floor, the painting peeling, wooden bars Papa had nailed on the windows so we wouldn't fall out. You live there? The way she said it made me feel like nothing. There. I loved there. I nodded.
I knew then I had to have a house. A real house. One I could point to. But this isn't it. The house on Mango Street isn't it. For the time being, Mama says. Temporary, says Papa. But I know how those things go.

Hairs.

Everybody in our family has different hair. My Papa's hair is like a broom, all up in the air. And me, my hair is lazy. It never obeys barrettes or bands. Carlos' hair is thick and straight. He doesn't need to comb it. Nenny's hair is slippery——slides out of your hand. And Kiki, who is the youngest, has hair like fur.
But my mother's hair, my mother's hair, like little rosettes, like little candy circles all curly and pretty because she pinned it in pincurls all day, sweet to put your nose into when she is holding you, holding you and you feel safe, is the warm smell of bread before you bake it, is the smell when she makes room for you on her side of the bed still warm with her skin, and you sleep near her, the rain outside falling and Papa snoring. The snoring, the rain, and Mama's hair that smells like bread.

Boys & Girls

The boys and the girls live in separate worlds. The
boys in their universe and we in ours. My brothers for
example. They've got plenty to say to me and Nenny inside
the house. But outside they can't be seen talking to girls.
Carlos and Kiki are each other's best friend ... not ours.
Nenny is too young to be my friend. She's just my
sister and that was not my fault. You don't pick your sisters,
you just get them and sometimes they come like Nenny.
She can't play with those Vargas kids or she'll turn
out just like them. And since she comes right after me, she
is my responsibility.
Someday I will have a best friend all my own. One I
can tell my secrets to. One who will understand my jokes
without my having to explain them. Until then I am a red
balloon, a balloon tied to an anchor.

My Name

In English my name means hope. In Spanish it means
too many letters. It means sadness, it means waiting. It is
like the number nine. A muddy color. It is the Mexican
records my father plays on Sunday mornings when he is
shaving, songs like sobbing.
It was my great-grandmother's name and now it is
mine. She was a horse woman too, born like me in the
Chinese year of the horse-which is supposed to be bad
luck if you're born female-but I think this is a Chinese
lie because the Chinese, like the Mexicans, don't like their
women strong.
My great-grandmother. I would've liked to have known her, a wild horse of a woman, so wild she wouldn't
marry. Until my great-grandfather threw a sack over her
head and carried her off. Just like that, as if she were a
fancy chandelier. That's the way he did it.
And the story goes she never forgave him. She looked I
out the window her whole life, the way so many women sit
their sadness on an elbow. I wonder if she made the best
with what she got or was she sorry because she couldn't be
all the things she wanted to be. Esperanza. I have inherited
her name, but I don't want to inherit her place by the
window.
At school they say my name funny as if the syllables
were made out of tin and hurt the roof of your mouth.
But in Spanish my name is made out of a softer something,
like silver, not quite as thick as sister's name Magdalena-which is uglier than mine. Magdalena who at
least can come home and become Nenny. But I am always
Esperanza.
I would like to baptize myself under a new name, a
name more like the real me, the one nobody sees. Esperanza
as Lisandra or Maritza or Zeze the X. Yes. Something
like Zeze the X will do.

Cathy Queen of Cats
She says, I am the great great grand cousin of the
queen of France. She lives upstairs, over there, next door
to Joe the baby-grabber. Keep away from him, she says.
He is full of danger. Benny and Blanca own the comer
store. They're okay except don't lean on the candy counter.
Two girls raggedy as rats live across the street. You don't
want to know them. Edna is the lady who owns the building
next to you. She used to own a building big as a whale, but
her brother sold it. Their mother said no, no, don't ever
sell it. I won't. And then she closed her eyes and he sold
it. Alicia is stuck-up ever since she went to college. She used
to like me but now she doesn't.
Cathy who is queen of cats has cats and cats and cats.
Baby cats, big cats, skinny cats, sick cats. Cats asleep like
little donuts. Cats on top of the refrigerator. Cats taking a
walk on the dinner table. Her house is like cat heaven.
You want a friend, she says. Okay, I'll be your friend.
But only till next Tuesday. That's when we move away.
Got to. Then as if she forgot I just moved in, she says the
neighborhood is getting bad.
Cathy'S father will have to fly to France one day and
find her great great distant grand cousin on her father's
side and inherit the family house. How do I know this is
so? She told me so. In the meantime they'll just have to
move a little farther north from Mango Street, a little farther
away every time people like us keep moving in.
Our Good Day

If you give me five dollars I will be your friend forever.
That's what the little one tells me.
Five dollars is cheap since I don't have any friends
except Cathy who is only my friend till Tuesday.
Five dollars, five dollars.
She is trying to get somebody to chip in so they can
buy a bicycle from this kid named Tito. They already have
ten dollars and all they need is five more.
Only five dollars, she says.
Don', talk to them, says Cathy. Can't you see they smell
like a broom.
But I like them. Their clothes are crooked and old. They are wearing shiny Sunday shoes without socks. It
makes their bald ankles all red, but I like them. Especially
the big one who laughs with all her teeth. I like her even
though she lets the little one do all the talking.
Five dollars, the little one says, only five. !
Cathy is tugging my arm and I know whatever I do
next will make her mad forever.
Wait a minute, I say, and run inside to get the five
dollars. I have three dollars saved and I take two of Nenny's.
She's not home, but I'm sure she'll he glad when she
finds out we own a bike. When I get back, Cathy is gone
like I knew she would be, but I don't care. I have two new
friends and a bike too.
My name is Lucy, the big one says. This here is Rachel
my sister.
I'm her sister, says Rachel. Who are you?
And I wish my name was Cassandra or Alexis or Maritza-anything
but Esperanza-but when I tell them my
name they don't laugh.
We come from Texas, Lucy says and grins. Her was
born here, but me I'm Texas.
You mean she, I say.
No, 1'1)1 from Texas, and doesn't get it.
This bike is three ways ours, says Rachel who is thinking
ahead already. Mine today, Lucy's tomorrow and yours
day after.
But everybody wants to ride it today because the bike
is new, so we decide to take turns after tomorrow. Today
it belongs to all of us.
I don't tell them about Nenny just yet. It's too complicated.
Especially since Rachel almost put out Lucy's eye
about who was going to get to ride it first. But finally we
agree to ride it together. Why not?
Because Lucy has long legs; she pedals. I sit on the back seat and Rachel is skinny enough to get up on the
handlebars which makes the bike all wobbly as if the wheels
are spaghetti, hut after a bit you get used to it.
We ride fast and faster. Past my house, sad and red
and crumbly in places, past Mr. Benny's grocery on the
corner, and down the avenue which is dangerous. Laundromat, junkstore, drugstore, windows and cars and more
cars, and around the block back to Mango.
People on the bus wave. A very fat lady crossing the
street says, You sure got quite a load there.
Rachel shouts, You got quite a load there too. She is
very sassy.
Down, down Mango Street we go. Rachel, Lucy, me.
Our new bicycle. Laughing the crooked ride back.

Laughter
Nenny and I don't look like sisters ... not right away.
Not the way you can tell with Rachel and Lucy who have
the same fat popside lips like everybody else in their family.
But me and Nenny, we are more alike than you would
know. Our laughter for example. Not the shy ice cream
bells' giggle of Rachel and Lucy's family, but all ofa sudden
and surprised like a pile of dishes breaking. And other
things I can't explain.
One day we were passing a house that looked, in my
mind, like houses I had seen in Mexico. I don't know why.
There was nothing about the house that looked exactly like the homes I remembered. I'm not even sure why I thought it but it seemed to feel right.
Look. at that house, I said, it looks like Mexico.
Rachel and Lucy look at me like I'm crazy, but before
Lucy can let out a laugh, Nenny says: Yes, that's Mexico all
right. That's what I was thinking exactly.

Gil's Furniture Bought & Sold

There is a junk store. An old man owns it. We bought
a used refrigerator from him once, and Carlos sold a box
of magazines for a dollar. The store is small with just a
dirty window for light. He doesn't turn the lights on unless
you got money to buy things with, so in the dark we look
and see all kinds of things, me and Nenny. Tables with
their feet upside-down and rows and rows of refrigerators
with round corners and couches that spin dust in the air
when you punch them and a hundred T.V.'s that don't
work probably. Everything is on top of everything so the
whole store has skinny aisles to walk through. You can get
lost easy.
The owner, he is a black man who doesn't talk much
and sometimes if you didn't know better you could be in there a long time before your eyes notice a pair of gold glasses floating in the dark. Nenny who thinks she is smart and talks to any old man, asks lots of questions. Me, I never
said nothing to him except once when I bought the Statue
of liberty for a dime.
But Nenny, I hear her asking one time how's this here
and the man says, This, this is a music box, and I turn
around quick thinking he means a pretty box with flowers
painted on it, with a ballerina inside. Only there's nothing
like that where this old man is pointing, just a wood box
that's old and got a big brass record in it with holes. Then
he starts it up and all sorts of things start happening. It's
like all of a sudden he let go a million moths all over the
dusty furniture and swan-neck shadows and in our bones.
It's like drops of water. Or like marimbas only with a funny
little plucked sound to it like if you were running your
fingers across the teeth of a metal comb.
And then I don't know why, but I have to turn around
and pretend I don't care about the box so Nenny won't see
how stupid I am. But Nenny, who is stupider, already is
asking how much and I can see her fingers going for the
quarters in her pants pocket.

This, the old man says shutting the lid, this ain't for
sale.

Meme Ortiz

Meme Ortiz moved into Cathy's house after her family
moved away. His name isn't really Meme. His name isJuan.
But when we asked him what his name was he said Meme,
and that's what everybody calls him except his mother.
Meme has a dog with gray eyes, a sheepdog with two
names, one in English and one in Spanish. The dog is big,
like a man dressed in a dog suit, and runs the same way
its owner does, clumsy and wild and with the limbs flopping
allover the place like untied shoes.

Cathy's father built the house Meme moved into. It
is wooden. Inside the floors slant. Some rooms uphill. Some
down. And there are no closets. Out front there are twenty one steps, all lopsided and jutting like crooked teeth (made
that way on purpose, Cathy said, so the rain will slide off),
and when Meme's mama calls from the doorway, Meme goes scrambling up the twenty-one wooden stairs with the
dog with two names scrambling after him.

Around the back is a yard, mostly dirt, and a greasy
bunch of boards that used to be a garage. But what you
remember most is this tree, huge, with fat arms and mighty
families of squirrels in the higher branches. All around,
me neighborhood of roofs, black-tarred and A-framed,
and in their gutters, the balls that never came back down
to earth. Down at the base of the tree, the dog with two
names barks into the empty air, and there at the end of
the block, looking smaller still, our house with its feet
tucked under like a cat.
This is the tree we chose for the First Annual Tarzan
Jumping Contest. Meme won. And broke both arms.

Louie, His Cousin & His Other Cousin

Downstairs from Meme's is a basement apartment that
Meme's mother fixed up and rented to a Puerto Rican
family. Louie's family. Louie is the oldest in a family of
little sisters. He is my brother's friend really, but I know
he has two cousins and that his T-shirts never stay tucked
in his pants.
Louie's girl cousin is older than us. She lives with
Louie's family because her own family is in Puerto Rico.
Her name is Marin or Maris or something like that, and
she wears dark nylons all the time and lots of makeup she
gets free from selling Avon. She can't come out-gotta
baby-sit with Louie's sisters-but she stands in the doorway a lot, all the time singing, clicking her fingers, the same song:

Apples, peaches, pumpkin pah-ay.
You're in love and so am ah-ay.

Louie has another cousin. We only saw him once, but
it was important. We were playing volleyball in the alley
when he drove up in this great big yellow Cadillac with
whitewalls and a yellow scarf tied around the mirror.
Louie's cousin had his arm out the window. He honked a
couple of times and a lot of faces looked out from Louie's
back window and then a lot of people came out-Louie,
Marin and all the little sisters.
Everybody looked inside the car and asked where he
got it. There were white rugs and white leather seats. We
all asked for a ride and asked where he got it. Louie's cousin
said get in.
We each had to sit with one of Louie's little sisters on
our lap, but that was okay. The seats were big and soft like
a sofa, and there was a little white cat in the back window
whose eyes lit up when the car stopped or turned. The
windows didn't roll up like in ordinary cars. Instead there
was a button that did it for you automatically. We rode up
the alley and around the block six times, but Louie's cousin
said he was going to make us walk home if we didn't stop
playing with the windows or touching the FM radio.
The seventh time we drove into the alley we heard
sirens ... real quiet at first, but then louder. Louie's cousin
stopped the car right where we were and said, Everybody
out of the car. Then he took off flooring that car into a
yellow blur. We hardly had time to think when the cop car
pulled in the alley going just as fast. We saw the yellow
Cadillac at the end of the block trying to make a left-hand
turn, but our alley is too skinny and the car hashed into
a lamppost.
Marin screamed and we ran down the block to where
the cop car's siren spun a dizzy blue. The nose of that yellow
Cadillac was all pleated like an alligator's, and except for
a bloody lip and a bruised forehead, Louie's cousin was
okay. They put handcuffs on him and put him in the backseat
of the cop car, and we all waved as they drove away.

Marin

Marin's boyfriend is in Puerto Rico. She shows us his
letters and makes us promise not to tell anybody they're
getting married when she goes back to P.R. She says he
didn't get a job yet, but she's saving the money she gets
from selling Avon and taking care of her cousins.
Marin says that if she stays here next year, she's going
to get a real job downtown because that's where the best
jobs are, since you always get to look beautiful and get to
wear nice clothes and can meet someone in the subway who
might marry you and take you to live in a big house far
away.
But next year Louie's parents are going to send her back to her mother with a letter saying she's too much
trouble, and that is too bad because I like Marin. She is
older and knows lots of things. She is the one who told us
how Davey the Baby's sister got pregnant and what cream
is best for taking off moustache hair and if you count the
white flecks on your fingernails you can know how many
boys are thinking of you and lots of other things I can't
remember now.
We never see Marin until her aunt comes home from -.
work, and even then she can only stay out in front. She is
there every night with the radio. When the light in her
aunt's room goes out, Marin lights a cigarette and it doesn't
matter if it's cold out or if the radio doesn't work or if we've
got nothing to say to each other. What matters, Marin says,
is for the boys to see us and for us to see them. And since
Marin's skirts are shorter and since her eyes are pretty,
and since Marin is already older than us in many ways, the
boys who do pass by say stupid things like I am in love with
those two green apples you call eyes, give them to me why
don't you. And Marin just looks at them without even blinking and is not afraid.
Marin, under the streetlight, dancing by herself, is
singing the same song somewhere. I know. Is waiting for
a car to stop, a star to fall, someone to change her life.

Those Who Don't

Those who don't know any better come into our neighborhood
scared. They think we're dangerous. They think
we will attack them with shiny knives. They are stupid
people who are lost and got here by mistake.
But we aren't afraid. We know the guy with the crooked
eye is Davey the BabY's brother, and the tall one next to
him in the straw brim, that's Rosa's Eddie V., and the big
one that looks like a dumb grown man, he's Fat Boy, though
he's not fat anymore nor a boy.
All brown all around, we are safe. But watch us drive
into a neighborhood of another color and our knees go
shakity-shake and our car windows get rolled up tight and
our eyes look straight. Yeah. That is how it goes and goes.

There was an Old Woman She Had So Many Children She Didn't Know What to Do

Rosa Vargas' kids are too many and too much. It's
not her fault you know, except she is their mother and
only one against so many.
They are bad those Vargases, and how can they help
it with only one mother who is tired all the time from
buttoning and bottling and babying, and who cries every
day for the man who left without even leaving a dollar for bologna or a note explaining how come.
The kids bend trees and bounce between cars and
dangle upside down from knees and almost break like
fancy museum vases you can't replace. They think it's
funny. They are without respect for all things living, including themselves.
But after a while you get tired of being worried about
kids who aren't even yours. One day they are playing
chicken on Mr. Benny's roof. Mr. Benny says, Hey ain't
you kids know better than to he swinging up there? Come
down, you come down right now, and then they just spit.
See. That's what I mean. No wonder everybody gave
up. Just stopped looking out when little Efren chipped his
buck tooth on a parking meter and didn't even stop Refugia
from getting her head stuck between two slats in the back
gate and nobody looked up not once the day Angel Vargas
learned to fly and dropped from the sky like a sugar donut,
just like a faIling star, and exploded down to earth without
even an ""Oh.""

Alicia Who Sees Mice

Close your eyes and they'll go away, her father says,
or You're just imagining. And anyway, a woman's place is
sleeping so she can wake up early with the tortilla star, the
one that appears early just in time to rise and catch the
hind legs hide behind the sink, beneath the four-clawed
tub, under the swollen floorboards nobody fixes, in the
corner of your eyes.
Alicia, whose mama died, is sorry there is no one older
to rise and make the lunchbox tortillas. Alicia, who inherited
her mama's rolling pin and sleepiness, is young and
smart and studies for the first time at the university. Two
trains and a bus, because she doesn't want to spend her whole life in a factory or behind a rolling pin. Is a good
girl, my friend, studies all night and sees the mice, the ones
her father says do not exist. Is afraid of nothing except
four-legged fur. And fathers.

Darius & The Clouds

You can never have too much sky. You can fall asleep
and wake up drunk on sky, and sky can keep you safe when
you are sad. Here there is too much sadness and not
enough sky. Butterflies too are few and so are flowers and
most things that are beautiful. Still, we take what we can
get and make the best of it.
Darius, who doesn't like school, who is sometimes stupid
and mostly a fool, said something wise today, though
most days he says nothing. Darius, who chases girls with
firecrackers or a stick that touched a rat and thinks he's
tough, today pointed up because the world was full of
clouds, the kind like pillows.
You all see that cloud, that fat one there? Darius said,
that? Where? That one next to the one that look like
popcorn. That one there. See that. That's God, Darius said.
God? somebody little asked. God, he said, and made it
simple.

And Some More

The Eskimos got thirty different names for snow, I
say. I read it in a book.
I got a cousin, Rachel says. She got three different
names.
There ain't thirty different kinds of snow, Lucy says.
There are two kinds. The clean kind and the dirty kind,
clean and dirty. Only two.
There are a million zillion kinds, says Nenny. No two
exactly alike. Only how do you remember which one is
which?
She got three last names and, let me see, two first
names. One in English and one in Spanish ...
And clouds got at least ten different names, I say.
Names for clouds? Nenny asks. Names just like you and me?
That up there, that's cumulus, and everybody looks
up.
Cumulus are cute, Rachel says. She would say something
like that.
What's that one there? Nenny asks, pointing a finger.
That's cumulus too. They're all cumulus today. Cumulus,
cumulus, cumulus.
No, she says. That there is Nancy, otherwise known
as Pig-eye. And over there her cousin Mildred, and little
Joey, Marco, Nereida and Sue.
There are all different kinds of clouds. How many
different kinds of clouds can you think of?
Well, there's these already that look like shaving
cream ...
And what about the kind that looks like you combed
its hair? Yes, those are clouds too.
Phyllis, Ted, Alfredo and Julie ...
There are clouds that look like big fields of sheep,
Rachel says. Them are my favorite.
And don't forget nimbus the rain cloud, I add, that's
something.
Jose and Dagoberto, Alicia, Raul, Edna, Alma and
Rickey ...
There's that wide puffy cloud that looks like your face
when you wake up after falling asleep with all your clothes
on.
Reynaldo, Angelo, Albert, Armando, Mario ...
Not my face. Looks like your fat face.
Rita, Margie, Ernie ...
Whose fat face?
Esperanza's fat face, that's who. Looks like Esperan­za's ugly face when she comes to school in the morning.
Anita, Stella, Dennis, and Lolo ...
Who you calling ugly, ugly?
Richie, Yolanda, Hector, Stevie, Vincent ...
Not you. Your mama, that's who.
My mama? You better not be saying that, Lucy Guerrero.
You better not be talking like that ... else you can
say goodbye to being my friend forever.
I'm saying your mama's ugly like ... ummm ...
... like bare feet in September!
That does it! Both of yous better get out of my yard
before I call my brothers.
Oh, we're only playing.
I can think of thirty Eskimo words for you, Rachel.
Thirty words that say what you are.
Oh yeah, well I can think of some more.
Uh-oh, Nenny. Better get the broom. Too much trash
in our yard today.
Frankie, Licha, Maria, Pee Wee ...
Nenny, you better tell your sister she is really crazy
because Lucy and me are never coming back here again.
Forever.

Reggie, Elizabeth, Lisa, Louie ...
You can do what you want to do, Nenny, but you
better not talk to Lucy or Rachel if you want to be my sister.
You know what you are, Esperanza? You are like the
Cream of Wheat cereal. You're like the lumps.
Yeah, and you're foot fleas, that's you.
Chicken lips.
Rosemary, Dalia, Lily ...
Cockroach jelly.
Jean, Geranium and Joe ...
Cold frijoles
Mimi, Michael, Moe ...
Your mama's frijoles.
Your ugly mama's toes.
That's stupid.
Bebe, Blanca, Benny ...
Who's stupid?
Rachel, Lucy, Esperanza, and Nenny.



The Family of Little Feet

There was a family. All were little. Their arms were
little, and their hands were little, and their height was not
tall, and their feet very small.
The grandpa slept on the living room couch and
snored through his teeth. His feet were fat and doughy
like thick tamales, and these he powdered and stuffed into white socks and brown leather shoes.
The grandma's feet were lovely as pink pearls and
dressed in velvety high heels that made her walk with a
wobble, but she wore them anyway because they were
pretty.
The baby's feet had ten tiny toes, pale and see-through like a salamander's. and these he popped into his mouth
whenever he was hungry.
The mother's feet, plump and polite. descended like
I white pigeons from the sea of pillow, across the linoleum
roses, down down the wooden stairs, over the chalk hopscotch
squares, 5,6, 7, blue sky.
Do you want this? And gave us a paper bag with one
pair of lemon shoes and one red and one pair of dancing shoes that used to be white but were now pale blue.
Here, and we said thank you and waited until she went
upstairs. Hurray! Today we are Cinderella because our feet fit
exactly, and we laugh





A Rice Sandwich

The special kids, the ones who wear keys around their
necks, get to eat in the canteen. The canteen! Even the
name sounds important. And these kids at lunch time go
there because their mothers aren't home or horne is too
far away to get to.
My home isn't far but it's not close either, and somehow
I got it in my head one day to ask my mother to make
me a sandwich and write a note to the principal so I could
eat in the canteen too.
Oh no, she says pointing the butter knife at me as if
I'm starting trouble, no sir. Next thing you k.now everybody
will be wanting a bag lunch-I'll be up all night cuttingbRad into little triangles, this one with mayonnaise, this
one with mustard, no pickles on mine, but mustard on one
side please. You kids just like to invent more work for me.
But Nenny says she doesn't want to eat at schoolever-because
she likes to go horne with her best friend
Gloria who lives across the schoolyard. Gloria's mama has
it big color T.V. and all they do is watch cartoons. Kiki and
Carlos, on the other hand, are patrol boys. They don't want
to eat at school either. They like to stand out in the cold
especially if it's raining. They think suffering is good for
you ever since they saw that movie 300 Spartans.
I'm no Spartan and hold up an anemic wrist to prove
it. I can't even blow up a balloon without getting dizzy.
And besides, I know how to make my own lunch. If I ate
at school there'd be less dishes to wash. You would see me
less and less and like me better. Everyday at noon my chair
would be empty. Where is my favorite daughter you would
cry, and when I came home finally at three p.m. you would
appreciate me.
Okay, okay, my mother says after three days of this.
And the following morning I get to go to school with my
mother's letter and a rice sandwich because we don't have lunch meat.  Mondays or Fridays, it doesn't matter, mornings always
go by slow and this day especially. But lunchtime
came finally and I got to get in line with the stay-at-school
kids. Everything is fine until the nun who knows all the
canteen kids by heart looks at me and says: You, who sent
you here? And since I am shy, I don't say anything, just
hold out my hand with the letter. This is no good, she says,
till Sister Superior gives the okay. Go upstairs and see her.
And so I went.
I had to wait for two kids in front of me to get hollered
at, one because he did something in class, the other because he didn't. My turn came and I stood in front of the big
desk with holy pictures under the glass while the Sister
Superior read my letter. It went like this:

Dear Sister Superior,
Please let Esperanza eat in the lunchroom
because she lives too far away and she gets tired.
As you can see she is very skinny. I hope to God
she does not faint.
Thanking you,
Mrs. E. Cordero

You don't live far, she says. You live across the boulevard.
That's only four blocks. Not even. Three maybe.
Three long blocks away from here. I bet I can see your
house from my window. Which one? Come here. Which
one is your house?
And then she made me stand up on a box of books
and point. That one? she said, pointing to a row of ugly
three-flats, the ones even the raggedy men are ashamed to
go into. Yes, I nodded even though I knew that wasn't my
house and started to cry. I always cry when nuns yell at
me, even if they're not yelling.
Then she was sorry and said I could stay-just for
today, not tomorrow or the day after-you go home. And
I said yes and could I please have a Kleenex-I had to
blow my nose.
In the canteen, which was nothing special, lots of boys
and girls watched while I cried and ate my sandwich, the
bread already greasy and the rice cold.

Chanclas

It's me-Mama, Mama said. I open up and she's there
with bags and bi~ boxes, the new clothes and, yes, she's got
the socks and a new slip with a little rose on it and a pink and-white
striped dress. What about the shoes? I forgot.
Too late now. I'm tired. Whew!
Six-thirty already and my little cousin's baptism is
over. All day waiting, the door locked, don't open up for
nobody, and I don't till Mama gets back and buys everything
except the shoes.
Now Uncle Nacho is coming in his car, and we have
to hurry to get to Precious Blood Church quick because
that's where the baptism party is, in the basement rented for today for dancing and tamales and everyone's kids running
all over the place. Mama dances, laughs, dances. All of a sudden, Mama is sick. I fan her hot face with a paper plate. Too many tamales, but uncle Nacho says too many this and tilts his thumb to his lips.
Everybody laughing except me, because I'm wearing
the new dress, pink and white with stripes, and new underclothes
and new socks and the old saddle shoes I wear
to school, brown and white, the kind I get every September
because they last long and they do. My feet scuffed and
round, and the heels all crooked that look dumb with this
dress, so I just sit.
Meanwhile that boy who is my cousin by first communion
or something asks me to dance and I can't. Just
stuff my feet under the metal folding chair stamped Precious
Blood and pick on a wad of brown gum that's stuck
beneath the seat. I shake my head no. My feet growing
bigger and bigger.
Then Uncle Nacho is pulling and pulling my arm and
it doesn't matter how new the dress Mama bought is because
my feet are ugly until my uncle who is a liar says,
You are the prettiest girl here, will you dance, but I believe
him, and yes, we are dancing, my Uncle Nacho and me,
only I don't want to at first. My feet swell big and heavy
like plungers, but I drag them across the linoleum Roor
straight center where Uncle wants to show off the new
dance we learned. And Uncle spins me, and my skinny
arms bend the way he taught me, and my mother watches,
and my little cousins watch, and the boy who is my cousin
by first communion watches, and everyone says, wow, who
are those two who dance like in the movies, until I forget
that I am wearing only ordinary shoes, brown and white,
the kind my mother buys each year for school.
And all I hear is the clapping when the music stops.
My uncle and me bow and he walks me back in my thick
shoes to my mother who is proud to be my mother. All
night the boy who is a man watches me dance. He watched
me dance.

Hips
I like coffee, I like tea.

Ilike the boys and the boys like me.

Yes, no, maybe so. Yes, no, maybe so ...

One day you wake up and they are there. Ready and
waiting like a new Buick with the keys in the ignition. Ready
to take you where?
They're good for holding a baby when you're cooking,
Rachel says, turning the jump rope a little quicker. She has
no imagination.
You need them to dance, says Lucy..

If you don't get them you may turn into a man. Nenny believes this and she believes it. She is this way because of her
age.
That's right, I add before Lucy or Rachel can make
fun of her. She is stupid alright, but she is my sister.
But most important, hips are scientific, I say repeating
what Alicia already told me. It's the bones that let you know
which skeleton was a man's when it was a man and which
a woman's.
They bloom like roses, I continue because it's obvious
I'm the only one who can speak with any authority; I have
science on my side. The bones just one day open. Just like
that. One day you might decide to have kids, and then
where are you going to put them? Got to have room. Bones
got to give.
But don't have too many or your behind will spread.
That's how it is, says Rachel whose mama is as wide as a
boat. And we just laugh. What I'm saying is who here is ready? You gotta be
able to know what to do with hips when you get them, I
say making it up as I go. You gotta know how to walk with
hips, practice you know-like if half of you wanted to go
one way and the other half the other.
That's to lullaby it, Nenny says, that's to rock the baby
asleep inside you. And then she begins singing seashells,
copper bells, eroy, ivy, over.
I'm about to tell her that's the dumbest thing I've ever
heard, but the more I think about it ...
You gotta get the rhythm, and Lucy begins to dance.
She has the idea, though she's having trouble keeping her
end of the double-dutch steady.
It's gotta be just so, I say. Not too fast and not too
slow. Not too fast and not too slow.
We slow the double circles down to a certain speed so
Rachel who has just jumped in can practice shaking it.
I want to shake like hoochi-coochie, Lucy says. She is
crazy.
I want to move like heebie-jeebie, I say picking up on
the cue.
I want to be Tahiti. Or merengue. Or electricity.
Or tembleque!
Yes, tembleque. That's a good one.
And then it's Rachel who starts it:
Skip, sJcip,

snake in your hips.

Wiggle around

and break your lip.

Lucy waits a minute before her turn. She is thinking.
Then she begins:
The waitress with the big fat hips

who pays the rent with taxi tips . . .

says nobody in town will kiss her on the lips

because . ..

because she looks like Christopher Columbus!

Yes, no, maybe so. Yes, no, maybe so.

She misses on maybe so. I take a little while before

my turn, take a breath, and dive in:

Some are skinny like chuken lips.

Some are baggy like soggy Band-Aids

after you get out of the bathtub.

I don't care what kind I get.

Just as long as I get hips.

Everybody getting into it now except Nenny who is

still humming not a girl, not a boy, just a little baby. She's like

that.

When the two arcs open wide like jaws Nenny jumps in across from me, the rope tick-ticking, the little gold
earrings our mama gave her for her First Holy Communion
bouncing. She is the color of a bar of naphtha laundry
soap, she is like the little brown piece left at the end of the
wash, the hard little bone, my sister. Her mouth opens.
She begins:

My mother and your mother were washing clothes.
My mother punched your mother right in the nese.
What color blood came out1
Not that old song, I say. You gotta use your own song.
Make it up, you know? But she doesn't get it or won't. It's
hard to say which. The rope turning, turning, turning.
Engine, engine number nine,
running down Chicago line.
If the train runs off the track
do you want your money back
Do you want your MONEY back
Yes, no, maybe so. Yes, no, maybe so ...

I can tell Lucy and Rachel are disgusted, but they
don't say anything because she's my sister.
Yes, no, maybe so. Yes, no, maybe so . ..
Nenny, I say, but she doesn't hear me. She is too many
light-years away. She is in a world we don't belong to anymore.
Nenny. Going. Going.
Y-E-S spells yes and out you go!



The First Job -- Will

It wasn't as if I didn't want to work. I did. I had even
gone to the social security office the month before to get
my social security number. I needed money. The Catholic
high school cost a lot, and Papa said nobody went to public
school unless you wanted to turn out bad.
I thought I'd find an easy job, the kind other kids
had, working in the dime store or maybe a hotdog stand.
And though I hadn't started looking yet, I thought I might
the week after next. But when I came home that afternoon,
all wet because Tito had pushed me into the open water
hydrant-only I had sort of let him-Mama called me in
the kitchen before I could even go and change, and AuntLa1a _~ sitting there drinking her coffee with a spoon.
Aunt Lala said she had found a job for me at the Peter
Pan Photo Finishers on North Broadway where she
worked, and how old was I, and to show up tomorrow
saying I was one year older, and that was that.
So the next morning I put on the navy blue dress that
made me look older and borrowed money for lunch and
bus fare because Aunt Lala said I wouldn't get paid till the
next Friday, and I went in and saw the boss of the Peter
Pan Photo Finishers on North Broadway where Aunt Lala
worked and lied about my age like she told me to and sure
enough, I started that same day.
In my job I had to wear white gloves. I was supposed
to match negatives with their prints, just look at the picture
and look for the same one on the negative strip, put it in
the envelope, and do the next one. That's all. I didn't know
where these envelopes were coming from or where they
were going. I just did what I was told.
It was real easy, and I guess I wouldn't have minded
it except that you got tired after a while and I didn't know
if I could sit down or not, and then I started sitting down
only when the two ladies next to me did. After a while they
started to laugh and came up to me and said I could sit
when I wanted to, and I said I knew.
When lunchtime came, I was scared to eat alone in
the company lunchroom with all those men and ladies looking,
so I ate real fast standing in one of the washroom stalls
and had lots of time left over, so I went back to work early.
But then break time came, and not knowing where else to
go, I went into the coatroom because there was a bench
there.
I guess it was the time for the night shift or middle
shift to arrive because a few people came in and punched
the time clock, and an older Oriental man said hello andwe talked for a while about my just starting, and he said
we could be friends and next time to go in the lunchroom
and sit with him, and I felt better. He had nice eyes and 1
didn't feel so nervous anymore. Then he asked if 1 knew
what day it was, and when I said 1 didn't, he said it was his
birthday and would I please give him a birthday kiss. 1
thought I would because he was so old and just as I was
about to put my lips on his cheek, he grabs my face with
both hands and kisses me hard on the mouth and doesn't
let go.


Papa Who Wakes Up Tired In The Dark

Your abuelito is dead, Papa says early one morning
in my room. Esta muerto, and then as if he just heard the
news himself, crumples like a coat and cries, my brave Papa
cries. I have never seen my Papa cry and don't know what
to do.
I know he will have to go away, that he will take a
plane to Mexico, all the uncles and aunts will be there, and
they will have a black-and-white photo taken in front of
the tomb with flowers shaped like spears in a white vase
because this is how they send the dead away in that country.
Because I am the oldest, my father has told me first,
and now it is my turn to tell the others. I will have to explain why we can't play. I will have to tell them to be quiet today.
My Papa. his thick hands and thick shoes, who wakes
up tired in the dark, who combs his hair with water, drinks
his coffee, and is gone before we wake, today is sitting on
my bed.
And I think if my own Papa died what would I do. I
hold my Papa in my arms. I hold and hold and hold him.



Born Bad

Most likely I will go to hell and most likely I deserve
to be there. My mother says I was born on an evil day and
prays for me. Lucy and Rachel pray too. For ourselves and
for each other ... because of what we did to Aunt Lupe.
Her name was Guadalupe and she was pretty like my
mother. Dark. Good to look at. In her Joan Crawford dress
and swimmer's legs. Aunt Lupe of the photographs.
But I knew her sick from the disease that would not
go, her legs bunched under the yellow sheets, the bones
gone limp as worms. The yellow pillow, the yellow smell,
the bottles and spoons. Her head thrown back like a thirsty
lady. My aunt, the swimmer.
Hard to imagine her legs once strong, the bones hard
and parting water, clean sharp strokes, not bent and wrinkled like a baby, not drowning under the sticky yellow light.
Second-floor rear apartment. The naked light bulb. The
high ceilings. The light bulb always burning.
I don't know who decides who deserves to go bad. I
There was no evil in her birth. No wicked curse. One day - I believe she was swimming, and the next day she was sick.
It might have been the day that gray photograph was taken.
It might have been the day she was holding cousin Totchy
and baby Frank. It might have been the moment she
pointed to the camera for the kids to look and they
wouldn't.
Maybe the sky didn't look the day she fell down.
Maybe God was busy. It could be true she didn't dive right
one day and hurt her spine. Or maybe the story that she
fell very hard from a high step stool, like Totchy said, is
true.
But I think diseases have no eyes. They pick with a
dizzy finger anyone, just anyone. Like my aunt who happened
to be walking down the street one day in her Joan ,
Crawford dress, in her funny felt hat with the black feather,
cousin Totchy in one hand, baby Frank in the other.
Sometimes you get used to the sick and sometimes
the sickness, if it is there too long, gets to seem normal.
Th'is is how it was with her, and maybe this is why we chose
her.
It was a game, that's all. It was the game we played
every afternoon ever since that day one of us invented it-
can't remember who-I think it was me.
You had to pick somebody. You had to think of someone
everybody knew. Someone you could imitate and
everyone else would have to guess who it was. It started
out with famous people: Wonder Woman, the Beatles,
Marilyn Monroe.... But then somebody thought it'd be better if we changed the game a little. if we pretended we were Mr. Benny, or his wife Blanca, or Ruthie, or anybody we knew.
I don't know why we picked her. Maybe we were bored
that day. Maybe we got tired. We liked my aunt. She listened
to our stories. She always asked us to come back.
Lucy, me, Rachel. I hated to go there alone. The six blocks
to the dark apartment, second-floor rear building where
sunlight never came, and what did it matter? My aunt was
blind by then. She never saw the dirty dishes in the sink.
She couldn't see the ceilings dusty with flies, the ugly maroon walls, the bottles and sticky spoons. I can't forget the smell. Like sticky capsules filled with jelly. My aunt, a little oyster, a little piece of meat on an open shell for us to look at. Hello, hello. As if she had fallen into a well.
I took my library books to her house. I read her stories.
I liked the book The Waterbabies. She liked it too. I
never knew how sick she was until that day I tried to show
her one of the pictures in the book, a beautiful color picture
of the water babies swimming in the sea. I held the book
up to her face. I can't see it, she said, I'm blind. And then
I was ashamed.
She listened to every book, every poem I read her.
One day I read her one of my own. I came very dose. I
whispered it into the pillow:
I want to be
like the waves on the sea,
like the douds in the wind,
but I'm me.
One day I'll jump
out of my skin.
I'll shake the sky
like a hundred violins.
That's nice. That's very good, she said in her tired voice.
You just remember to keep writing, [speranza. You must
keep writing. It will keep you free, and I said yes, but at
that time I didn't know what she meant.
The day we played the game, we didn't know she was
going to die. We pretended with our heads thrown back,
our arms limp and useless, dangling like the dead. We
laughed the way she did. We talked the way she talked, the
way blind people talk without moving their head. We imitated
the way you had to lift her head a little so she could
drink water, she sucked it up slow out of a green tin cup.
The water was warm and tasted like metal. Lucy laughed.
Rachel too. We took turns being her. We screamed in the
weak voice of a parrot for Totchy to come and wash those
dishes. It was easy.
We didn't know. She had been dying such a long time,
we forgot. Maybe she was ashamed. Maybe she was embarrassed
it took so many years. The kids who wanted to
be kids instead of washing dishes and ironing their papa's
shirts, and the husband who wanted a wife again.
And then she died, my aunt who listened to my poems.
And then we began to dream the dreams.

Elenita, Cards, Palm, Water

Elenita, witch woman, wipes the table with a rag because
Ernie who is feeding the baby spilled Kool-Aid. She
says: Take that crazy baby out of here and drink your KoolAid
ill the living room. Can't you see I'm busy? Ernie takes
the baby into the living room where Bugs Bunny is on T.V.
Good lucky you didn't come yesterday, she says. The
planets were all mixed up yesterday.
Her T.V. is color and hig and all her pretty furniture
made out of red fur like the teddy bears they give away in
carnivals. She has them covered with plastic. I think this is
on account of the baby.
Yes, it's a good thing, I say.
But we stay in the kitchen because this is where she
works. The top of the refrigerator busy with holy candles,
some lit, some not, red and green and blue, a plaster saint
and a dusty Palm Sunday cross, and a picture of the voodoo
hand taped to the wall.
Get the water, she says.
I go to the sink and pick the only clean glass there, a
beer mug that says the beer that made Milwaukee famous,
and fill it up with hot water from the tap, then put the
glass of water on the center of the table, the way she taught
me.
Look in it; do you see anything?
But all I see are bubbles.
You see anybody's face?
Nope, just bubbles, I say.
That's okay, and she makes the sign of the cross over
the water three times and then begins to cut the cards.
They're not like ordinary playing cards, these cards.
They're strange, with blond men on horses and crazy baseball
bats with thorns. Golden goblets, sad-looking women
dressed in old-fashioned dresses, and roses that cry..
There is a good Bugs Bunny cartoon on T.V.) know,
I saw it before and recognize the music and wish) could
go sit on the plastic couch with Ernie and the baby, but
now my fortune begins. My whole life on that kitchen table:
past, present, future. Then she takes my hand and looks
into my palm. Closes it. Closes her eyes too.
Do you feel it, feel the cold?
Yes, I lie, but only a little.
Good, she says, Los esperitus are here. And begins.
This card, the one with the dark man on a dark horse,
this means jealousy, and this one, sorrow. Here a pillar of
bees and this a mattress of luxury. You will go to a wedding soon and did you lose an anchor of arms, yes, an anchor
of arms? It's clear that's what that means.
What about a house, I say, because that's what I came
for.
Ah, yes, a home in the heart. I see a home in the
heart.
Is that it?
That's what I see, she says, then gets up because the
kids are fighting. Elenita gets up to hit and then hug them.
She really does love them, only sometimes they are rude.
She comes back and can tell I'm disappointed. She's
a witch woman and knows many things. If you got a headache,
rub a cold egg across your face. Need to forget an
old romance? Take a chicken's foot, tie it with red string,
spin it over your head three times, then burn it. Bad spirits
keeping you awake? Sleep next to a holy candle for seven
days, then on the eighth day, spit. And lots of other stuff.
Only now she can tell I'm sad.
Baby, I'll look again if you want me to. And she looks
again into the cards, palm, water, and says uh-huh.
A home in the heart, I was right.
Only I don't get it.
A new house, a house made of heart. I'll light a candle
for you.
All this for five dollars I give her.
Thank you and goodbye and be careful of the evil
eye. Come back again on a Thursday when the stars are
stronger. And may the Virgin bless you. And shuts the
door.

Geraldo No Last Name

She met him at a dance. Pretty too, and young. Said
he worked in a restaurant, but she can't remember which
one. Geraldo. That's all. Green pants and Saturday shirt.
Geraldo. That's what he told her.
And how was she to know she'd be the last one to see
him alive. An accident, don't you know. Hit-and-run. Marin,
she goes to all those dances. Uptown. Logan. Embassy.
Palmer. Aragon. Fontana. The Manor. She likes to dance.
She knows how to do cumbias and salsas and rancheras
even. And he was just someone she danced with. Somebody
she met that night. That's right.
That's the story. That's what she said again and again.
<>ott to the hospital people and twice to the police. No
address. No name. Nothing in his pockets. Ain't it a shame.
Only Marin can't explain why it mattered, the hours
and hours, for somebody she didn't even know. The hospital
emergency room. Nobody but an intern working all
alone. And maybe if the surgeon would've come, maybe if
he hadn't lost so much blood, if the surgeon had only come,
they would know who to notify and where.
But what difference does it make? He wasn't anything
to her. He wasn't her boyfriend or anything like that. Just
another brazer who didn't speak English. Just another wetback.
You know the kind. The ones who always look
ashamed. And what was she doing out at three a.m. anyway?
Marin who was sent home with her coat and some
aspirin. How does she explain?
She met him at a dance. Geraldo in his shiny shirt and
green pants. Geraldo going to a dance.
What does it matter?
They never saw the kitchenettes. They never knew
about the two-room flats and sleeping rooms he rented,
the weekly money orders sent home, the currency exchange.
How could they?
His name was Geraldo. And his home is in another
country. The ones he left behind are far away, will wonder,
shrug. remember. Geraldo...he went north... we never
heard from him again.


Edna’s Ruthie


Ruthie, tall skinny lady with red lipstick and blue babushka,
one blue sock and one green because she forgot,
is the only grown-up we know who likes to play. She takes
her dog Bobo for a walk and laughs all by herself, that
Ruthie. She doesn't need anybody to laugh with, she just laughs.
She is Edna's daughter, the lady who owns the big
building next door, three apartments front and back. Every
week Edna is screaming at somebody, and every week
somebody has to move away. Once she threw out a pregnant
lady just because she owned a duck ... and it was a nice duck too. But Ruthie lives here and Edna can't throw
her out because Ruthie is her dauRhter.
Ruthie came one day, it seemed, out of nowhere.
AnReI Vargas was trying to teach us how to whistle. Then
I we heard someone whistling-beautiful like the Emperor's
nightingale-and when we turned around there was
Ruthie.
Sometimes we go shopping and take her with us, but
she never comes inside the stores and if she does she keeps
looking around her like a wild animal in a house for the
first time.
She likes candy. When we go to Mr. Benny's grocery
she gives us money to buy her some. She says make sure
it's the soft kind because her teeth hurt. Then she promises
to see the dentist next week, but when next week comes,
she doesn't go.
Ruthie sees lovely things everywhere. I might be telling
her ajoke and she'll stop and say: The moon is beautiful
like a balloon. Or somebody might be singing and she'll point to a few clouds: Look, Marlon Brando. Or a sphinx
winking. Or my left shoe.
Once some friends of Edna's came to visit and asked
Ruthie if she wanted to go with them to play bingo. The
car motor was running, and Ruthie stood on the steps
wondering whether to go. Should I go, Ma? she asked the
gray shadow behind the second-Roor screen. I don't care,
says the screen, go if you want. Ruthie looked at the ground. What do you think, Ma? Do what you want, how
should I know? Ruthie looked at the ground some more.
The car with the motor running waited fifteen minutes
and then they left. When we brought out the deck of cards
that night, we let Ruthie deal.
There were many things Ruthie could have been if
she wanted to. Not only is she a good whistler, but she can
sing and dance too. She had lots of job offers when she
was young, but she never took them. She got married in­stead and moved away to a pretty house outside the city.
Only thing I can't understand is why Ruthie is living on
Mango Street if she doesn't have to, why is she sleeping on!
a couch in her mother's living room when she has a real
house all her own, but she says she's just visiting and next weekend her husband's going to take her home. But the weekends come and go and Ruthie stays. No matter. We are glad because she is our friend.
I like showing Ruthie the books I take out of the library. Books are wonderful, Ruthie says, and then she
runs her hand over them as if she could read them in
braille, They're wonderful, wonderful, but I can't read anymore.
I get headaches. I need to go to the eye doctor next
week. I used to write children's books once, did I tell you?
One day I memorized all of ""The Walrus and the
Carpenter"" because I wanted Ruthie to hear me. ""The sun
was shining on the sea, shining with all his might ...""
Ruthie looked at the sky and her eyes got watery at times.
Finally I came to the last lines: ""But answer came there
none-and this was scarcely odd, because they'd eaten
everyone ..."" She took a long time looking at me before
she opened her mouth, and then she said, You have the
most beautiful teeth I have ever seen, and went inside.

The Earl of Tennessee

Earl lives next door in Edna's basement, behind the
flower boxes Edna paints green each year, behind the dusty
geraniums. We used to sit on the flower boxes until the day
Tito saw a cockroach with a spot of green paint on its head.
Now we sit on the steps that swing around the basement
apartment where Earl lives.
Earl works nights. His blinds are always closed during
the day. Sometimes he comes out and tells us to keep quiet.
The little wooden door that has wedged shut the dark for
so long opens with a sigh and lets out a breath of mold
and dampness, like books that have been left out in the
rain. This is the only time we see Earl except for when he
comes and goes to work. He has two little black dogs that
go everywhere with him. They don't walk. like ordinary
dogs, but leap and somersault like an apostrophe and
comma. f At night Nenny and I can hear when Earl comes home ,
from work. First the click and whine of the car door open­ f
ing, then the scrape of concrete, the excited tinkling of dog
tags, followed by the heavy jingling of keys, and finally the
moan of the wooden door as it opens and lets loose its sigh
of dampness.
Earl is a jukebox repairman. He learned his trade in
the South, he says. He speaks with a Southern accent,
smokes fat cigars and wears a felt hat-winter or summer,
hot or cold, don't matter-a felt hat. In his apartment are
boxes and boxes of 45 records, moldy and damp like the
smell that comes out of his apartment whenever he opens
the door. He gives the records away to us-all except the
country and western.
The word is that Earl is married and has a wife somewhere.
Edna says she saw her once when Earl brought her
to the apartment. Mama says she is a skinny thing, blond
and pale like salamanders that have never seen the sun.
But I saw her once too and she's not that way at all. And
the boys across the street say she is a tall red-headed lady
who wears tight pink pants and green glasses. We never
agree on what she looks like, but we do know this. Whenever
she arrives, he holds her tight by the crook of the
arm. They walk fast into the apartment, lock the door
behind them and never stay long.

Sire

I don't remember when I first noticed him looking at
me-Sire. But I knew he was looking. Every time. All the
time I walked past his house. Him and his friends sitting
on their bikes in front of the house, pitching pennies. They
didn't scare me. They did, but I wouldn't let them know.
I don't croSS the street like other girls. Straight ahead,
straight eyes. I walked past. I knew he was looking. I had
to prove to me I wasn't scared of nobody's eyes, not even
his. I had to look back hard, just once, like he was glass.
And I did. I did once. But I looked too long when he rode
his bike past me. I looked because I wanted to be brave,
straight into the dusty cat fur of his eyes and the bike
stopped and he bumped into a parked car, bumped, and
I walked fast. It made your blood freeze to have somebody
look at you like that. Somebody looked at me. Somebody
looked. But his kind, his ways. He is a punk, Papa says,
and Mama says not to talk to him.
And then his girlfriend came. Lois I heard him call
her. She is tiny and pretty and smells like baby's skin. I see
her sometimes running to the store for him. And once
when she was standing next to me at Mr. Benny's grocery
she was barefoot, and I saw her barefoot baby toenails all
painted pale pale pink, like little pink seashells, and she
smells pink like babies do. She's got big girl hands, and her
bones are long like ladies' bones, and she wears makeup
too. But she doesn't know how to tie her shoes. I do.
Sometimes I hear them laughing late, beer cans and
cats and the trees talking to themselves: wait, wait, wait.
Sire lets Lois ride his bike around the block, or they take
walks together. I watch them. She holds his hand, and he
stops sometimes to tie her shoes. But Mama says those kinds
of girls, those girls are the ones that go into alleys. Lois
who can't tie her shoes. Where does he take her?
Everything is holding its breath inside me. Everything
is waiting to explode like Christmas. I want to be all new
and shiny. I want to sit out bad at night, a boy around my
neck and the wind under my skirt. Not this way, every
evening talking to the trees, leaning out my window, imagining
what I can't see.
A boy held me once so hard, I swear, I felt the grip
and weight of his arms, but it was a dream.
Sire. How did you hold her? Was it? Like this? And
when you kissed her? Like this?



Four Skinny Trees


They are the only ones who understand me. I am the
only one who understands them. Four skinny trees with
skinny necks and pointy elbows like mine. Four who do
not belong here but are here. Four raggedy excuses planted
by the city. From our room we can hear them, but Nenny
just sleeps and doesn't appreciate these things.
Their strength is secret. They send ferocious roots
beneath the ground. They grow up and they grow down
and grab the earth between their hairy toes and bite the
sky with violent teeth and never quit their anger. This is
how they keep.
Let one forget his reason for being, they'd all droop like tulips in a glass, each with their arms around the other.
Keep, keep, keep, trees say when I sleep. They teach.
When I am too sad and too skinny to keep keeping,
when I am a tiny thing against so many bricks, then it is I
look at trees. When there is nothing left to look at on this
street. Four who grew despite concrete. Four who reach I
and do not forget to reach. Four whose only reason is to
, be and be.


No Speak English


Mamacita is the big mama of the man across the street,
third-floor front. Rachel says her name ought to be Mamasota,
but I think that's mean.
The man saved his money to bring her here. He saved
and saved because she was alone with the baby boy in that
country. He worked two jobs. He came home late and he
left early. Every day.
Then one day Mamacita and the baby boy arrived
in a yellow taxi. The taxi door opened like a waiter's
arm. Out stepped a tiny pink shoe, a foot soft as a rabbit's
ear, then the thick ankle, a Rutter of hips, fuchsia
roses and green perfume. The man had to pull her,
the taxicab driver had to push. Push, pull. Push, pull.
Poof!
All at once she bloomed. Huge, enormous, beautiful
to look at, from the salmon-pink feather on the tip of her
hat down to the little rosebuds of her toes. I couldn't take
my eyes off her tiny shoes.
Up, up, up the stairs she went with the baby boy in a
blue blanket, the man carrying her suitcases, her lavender
hatboxes, a dozen boxes of satin high heels. Then we didn't
see her.
Somebody said because she's too fat, somebody because
of the three flights of st3irs, but I believe she doesn't
come out because she is afraid to speak English, and maybe
this is so since she only knows eight words. She knows to
say: He not here for when the landlord comes, No speak
English if anybody else comes, and Holy smokes. I don't know
where she learned this, but I heard her say it one time and
it surprised me.
My father says when he came to this country he ate
hamandeggs for three months. Breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Hamandeggs. That was the only word he knew. He
doesn't eat hamandeggs anymore.
Whatever her reasons, whether she is fat, or can't
climb the stairs, or is afraid of English, she won't come
down. She sits all day by the window and plays the Spanish
radio show and sings all the homesick songs about her
. country in a voice that sounds like a seagull.
Home. Home. Home is a house in a photograph, a
pink house, pink as hollyhocks with lots of startled light.
The man paints the walls of the apartment pink, but it's
not the same, you know. She still sighs for her pint house,
and then I think she cries. I would.
Sometimes the man gets disgusted. He starts screaming
and you can hear it all the way down the street.
Ay. she says, she is sad.
Oh, he says. Not again.
,Ctuindo, ctuindo, ctuindor she asks. I
I
f~ jAy, caray! We are home. This is home. Here I am and
here I stay. Speak English. Speak English. Christ!
jAy! Mamacita, who does not belong, every once in a
while lets out a cry, hysterical. high, as if he had torn the
only skinny thread that kept her alive, the only road out
to that country.
And then to break her heart forever, the baby boy,
who has begun to talk. starts to sing the Pepsi commercial
he heard on T.V.
No speak English. she says to the child who is singing
in the language that sounds like tin. No speak English, no
speak English, and bubbles into tears. No, no, no, as if she
can't believe her ears.

Rafaela Who Drinks Coconut & Papaya Juice on Tuesday

On Tuesdays Rafaela's husband comes home late because
that's the night he plays dominoes. And then Rafaela,
who is still young but getting old from leaning out the
window SO much, gets locked indoors because her husband
is afraid Rafaela will run away since she is too beautiful to
look at.
Rafaela leans out the window and leans on her elbow
and dreams her hair is like Rapunzel's. On the corner there
is music from the bar, and Rafaela wishes she could go
there and dance before she gets old.
A long time passes and we forget she is up there
watching until she says: Kids, if I give you a dollar will you go to the store and buy me something? She throws a crumpled
donar down and always asks for coconut or sometimes
papaya juice, and we send it up to her in a paper shopping
bag she lets down with clothesline.
Rafaela who drinks and drinks coconut and papaya juice on Tuesdays and wishes there were sweeter drinks,
not bitter like an empty room, but sweet sweet like the island, like the dance hall down the street where women
much older than her throw green eyes easily like dice and
open homes with keys. And always there is someone offering sweeter drinks. someone promising to keep them
on a silver string.

Sally


Sally is  the girl with eyes like Egypt and nylons the
color of smoke. The boys at school think she's beautiful
because her hair is shiny black like raven feathers and when she laughs, she flicks her hair back like a satin shawl over
her shoulders and laughs.
Her father says to be this beautiful is trouble. They
are very strict in his religion. They are not supposed to
dance. He remembers his sisters and is sad. Then she can't
go oul. Sally I mean.
Sally, who taught you to paint your eyes like Cleopatra?
And if I roll the little brush with my tongue and chew it to a point and dip it in the muddy cake, the one
in the little red box, will you teach me?
I like your black coat and those shoes you wear, where
did you get them? My mother says to wear black so young
is dangerous, but I want to buy shoes just like yours, like
your black ones made out of suede, just like those. And
one day, when my mother's in a good mood, maybe after
my next birthday, I'm going to ask to buy the nylons too.
Cheryl, who is not your friend anymore, not since last
Tuesday before Easter, not since the day you made her ear
bleed, not since she called you that name and bit a hole in
your arm and you looked as if you were going to cry and
everyone was waiting and you didn't, you didn't, Sally, not
since then, you don't have a best friend to lean against the
schoolyard fence with, to laugh behind your hands at what
the boys say. There is no one to lend you her hairbrush.
The stories the boys tell in the coatroom, they're not
true. You lean against the schoolyard fence alone with your
eyes closed as if no one was watching, as if no one could
see you standing there, Sally. What do you think about
when you dose your eyes like that? And why do you always
have to go straight home after school? You become a different
Sally. You pull your skirt straight, you rub the blue
paint off your eyelids. You don't laugh, Sally. You look at
your feet and walk fast to the house you can't come out
from. Sally, do you sometimes wish you didn't have to go
home? Do you wish your feet would one day keep walking
and take you far away from Mango Street, far away and
maybe your feet would stop in front of a house, a nice one
with flowers and big windows and steps for you to climb
up two by two upstairs to where a room is waiting for you.
And if you opened the little window latch and gave it a
shove, the windows would swing open, all the sky would come in. There'd be no nosy neighbors watching, no motorcycles
and cars, no sheets and towels and laundry. Only
trees and more trees and plenty of blue sky. And you could
laugh, Sally. You could go to sleep and wake up and never
have to think who likes and doesn't like you. You could
close your eyes and you wouldn't have to worry what people
said because' you never belonged here anyway and nobody
could make you sad and nobody would think you're strange
because you like to dream and dream. And no one could
yell at you if they saw you out in the dark leaning against
a car, leaning against somebody without someone thinking
you are bad, without somebody saying it is wrong, without
the whole world waiting for you to make a mistake when
all you wanted, all you wanted, Sally, was to love and to
love and to love and ta love, and no one could call that
crazy.

Minerva Writes Poems


Minerva is only a little bit older than me but already
she has two kids and a husband who left. Her mother raised
her kids alone and it looks like her daughters will go that
way too. Minerva cries because her luck is unlucky. Every
night and every day. And prays. But when the kids are
asleep after she's fed them their pancake dinner, she writes
poems on little pieces of paper that she folds over and over
and holds in her hands a long time, little pieces of paper
that smell like a dime.
She lets me read her poems. I let her read mine. She
is always sad like a house on fire-always something wrong.
She has many troubles, but the big one is her husband who r
left and keeps leaving.
One day she is through and lets him know enough is
enough. Out the door he goes. Clothes, records, shoes. Out
the window and the door locked. But that night he comes
back and sends a big rock through the window. Then he
is sorry and she opens the door again. Same story.
Next week she comes over black and blue and asks .­
what can she do? Minerva. I don't know which way she'll II.
go. There is nothing I can do.



Bums in the Attic

I want a house on a hill like the ones with the gardens
where Papa works. We go on Sundays, Papa's day off. I
used to go. I don't anymore. You don't like to go out with
us, Papa says. Getting too old? Getting too stuck-up, says
Nenny. I don't tell them I am ashamed-all of us staring
out the window like the hungry. I am tired of looking at
what we can't have. When we win the lottery ... Mama
begins, and then I stop listening.
People who live on hills sleep so close to the stars they
forget those of us who live too much on earth. They don't
look down at all except to be content to live on hills. They have nothing to do with last week's garbage or fear of rats.
Night comes. Nothing wakes them but the ""'-md.
One day I'll own my own house, but I won't forget
who I am or where I came from. Passing bums will ask
Can I come in? I'll offer them the attic, ask them to stay.
because I know how it is to be without a house.
Some days after dinner, guests and I will sit in froot
of a fire. Floorboards will squeak upstairs. The attic grumble.
Rats? they'll ask.
Bums, I'll say, and I'll be happy.



Beautiful & Cruel

I am an ugly daughter. I am the one nobody comes
for.
Nenny says she won't wait her whole life for a husband
to come and get her, that Minerva's sister left her mother's
house by having a baby, but she doesn't want to go that
way either. She wants things all her own, to pick and choose.
Nenny has pretty eyes and it's easy to talk that way if you
are pretty.
My mother says when I get older my dusty hair will
settle and my blouse will learn to stay clean, but I have
decided not to grow up tame like the others who lay their
necks on the threshold waiting for the ball and chain.In the movies there is always one with red red lips . who is beautiful and cruel. She is the one who drives the
men crazy and laughs them all away. Her power is her own.
She will not give it away.
I have begun my own quiet war. Simple. Sure. I am
one who leaves the table like a man, without putting back
the chair or picking up the plate.


A Smart Cookie

I could've been somebody, you know? my mother says
and sighs. She has lived in this city her whole life. She can
speak two languages. She can sing an opera. She knows
how to fix a T.V. But she doesn't know which subway train
to take to get downtown. I hold her hand very tight while
we wait for the right train to arrive.
She used to draw when she had time. Now she draws
with a needle and thread, little knotted rosebuds, tulips
made of silk thread. Someday she would like to go to the
ballet. Someday she would like to see a play. Shf' borrows
opera records from the public library and sings with velvety
lungs powerful as morning glories. Today while cooking oatmeal she is Madame Butterfly
until she sighs and points the wooden spoon at me. I
could've been somebody, you know? Esperanza, you go to
school. Study hard. That Madame Butterfly was a fool. She
stirs the oatmeal. Look at my comadres. She means Izaura
whose husband left and Yolanda whose husband is dead.
Got to take care all your own, she says shaking her head.
Then out of nowhere:
Shame is a bad thing, you know. It keeps you down.
You want to know why I quit school? Because I didn't have
nice clothes. No clothes, but I had brains.
Yup. she says disgusted, stirring again. I was a smart
cookie then.


What Sally Said

He never hits me hard. She said her mama rubs lard on all the places where it hurts. Then at school she'd say she fell. That's where all the blue places come from. That's why her skin is always scarred.
But who believes her. A girl that big, a girl who comes
in with her pretty face all beaten and black can't be falling
off the stairs. He never hits me hard. But Sally doesn't tell about that time he hit her with
his hands just like a dog, she said, like if I was an animal. J
He thinks I'm going to run away like his sisters who made
the family ashamed. Just because I'm a daughter, and then
she doesn't say Sally was going to get permission to stay with us a little and one Thursday she came finally with a sack full of clothes and a paper bag of sweetbread her mama sent. And would've stayed too except when the dark came her father, whose eyes were little from crying, knocked on the door and said please come back, this is the last time. And she said Daddy and went home.
Then we didn't need to worry. Until one day Sally's
father catches her talking to a boy and the next day she
doesn't come to school. And the next. Until the way Sally
tells it, he just went crazy, he just forgot he was her father
between the buckle and the belt. You're not my daughter, you're not my daughter.
And then he broke into his hands.

The Monkey Garden

The monkey doesn't live there anymore. The monkey
moved-to Kentucky-and took his people with him. And
I was glad because I couldn't listen anymore to his wild
screaming at night, the twangy yakkety-yak of the people
who owned him. The green metal cage, the porcelain table
top, the family that spoke like guitars. Monkey, family,
table. All gone.
And it was then we took over the garden we had been
afraid to go into when the monkey screamed and showed
its yellow teeth.
There were sunflowers big as flowers on Mars and
thick cockscombs bleeding the deep red fringe of theater
curtains. There were dizzy bees and bow-tied fruit flies
turning somersaults and humming in the air. Sweet sweet
peach trees. Thorn roses and thistle and pears. Weeds like
so many squinty-eyed stars and brush that made your ankles
itch and itch until you washed with soap and water.
There were big green apples hard as knees. And everywhere
the sleepy smell of rotting wood, damp earth and
dusty hollyhocks thick and perfumy like the blue-blond
hair of the dead. Yellow spiders ran when we turned rocks over and
pale worms blind and afraid of light rolled over in their
sleep. Poke a stick in the sandy soil and a few blue-skinned
beetles would appear, an avenue of ants, so many crusty
lady bugs. This was a garden, a wonderful thing to look at
in the	 spring. But bit by bit, after the monkey left, the
garden began to take over itself. Flowers stopped obeying
the little bricks that kept them from growing beyond their
paths. Weeds mixed in. Dead cars appeared overnight like
mushrooms. First one and then another and then a pale
blue pickup with the front windshield missing. Before you knew it, the monkey garden became filled with sleepy cars.
, Things had a way of disappearing in the garden, as
if the garden itself ate them, or, as if with its old-man
memory, it put them away and forgot them. Nenny found
a dollar and a dead mouse between two rocks in the stone
wall where the morning glories climbed, and once when
we were playing hide-and-seek, Eddie Vargas laid his head
beneath a hibiscus tree and fell asleep there like a Rip Van
Winkle until somebody remembered he was in the game
and went back to look for him.
This, I suppose, was the reason why we went there.
Far away from where our mothers could find us. We and
a few old dogs who lived inside the empty cars. We made
a clubhouse once on the back of that old blue pickup. And besides. we liked to jump from the roof of one car to another
and pretend they were giant mushrooms.
Somebody started the lie that the monkey garden had
been there before anything. We liked to think the garden
could hide things for a thousand years. There beneath the
roots of soggy flowers were the bones of murdered pirates
and dinosaurs, the eye of a unicorn turned to coal.
This is where I wanted to die and where I tried one
day but not even the monkey garden would have me. It
was the last day I would go there.  Who was it that said I was getting too old to play the
games? Who was it I didn't listen to? I only remember that
when the others ran, I wanted to run too, up and down
and through the monkey garden, fast as the boys, not like
Sally who screamed if she got her stockings muddy.
I said, Sally, come on, but she wouldn't. She stayed
by the curb talking to Tito and his friends. Play with the
kids if you want, she said, I'm staying here. She could be
stuck-up like that if she wanted to, so I just left.
It was her own fault too. When I got back Sally was
pretending to be mad ... something about the boys having
stolen her keys. Please give them back to me, she said
punching the nearest one with a soft fist. They were laughing.
She was too. It was a joke I didn't get.
I wanted to go back with the other kids who were still
jumping on cars, still chasing each other through the garden,
but Sally had her own game.
One of the boys invented the rules. One of Tito's
friends said you can't get the keys back unless you kiss us
and Sally pretended to be mad at first but she said yes. It
was that simple.
I don't know why, but something inside me wanted
to throw a stick. Something wanted to say no when I
watched Sally going into the garden with Tito's buddies all  grinning. It was just a kiss, that's all. A li.ss for each one, So what, she said,
Only how come I felt angry inside. Like something
wasn't right. Sally went behind that old blue pickup to Usa
the boys and get her keys back, and I ran up three flights
of stairs to where Tito lived. His mother was ironing shirts.
She was sprinkling water on them from an empty pop bottle
and smoking a cigarette.
Your son and his friends stole Sally's keys and now
they won't give them back unless she kisses them and right
now they're making her kiss them, I said all out of breath
from the three flights of stairs.
Those kids, she said, not looking up from her ironing.
That's all?
What do you want me to do, she said, call the cops?
And kept on ironing.
I looked at her a long time, but couldn't think of
anything to say, and ran back down the three flights to the
garden where Sally needed to be saved. I took three big
sticks and a brick and figured this was enough.
But when I got there Sally said go home. Those boys
said leave us alone. I felt stupid with my brick. They all
looked at me as if I was the one that was crazy and made
me feel ashamed.
And then I don't know why but I had to run away. I
had to hide myself at the other end of the garden, in the
jungle part, under a tree that wouldn't mind if I lay down
and cried a long time. I closed my eyes like tight stars so
that I wouldn't, but I did. My face felt hot. Everything
inside hiccupped.
I read somewhere in India there are priests who can
will their heart to stop beating. I wanted to will my blood
to stop, my heart to quit its pumping. I wanted to be dead.
to turn into the rain, my eyes melt into the ground like two black snails. I wished and wished. I closed my eyes and
willed it, but when I got up my dress was green and I had
a headache.
I looked at my feet in their white socks and ugly round
shoes. They seemed far away. They didn't seem to be my
feet anymore. And the garden that had been such a good
place to play didn't seem mine either.



Red Clowns

Sally, you lied. It wasn't what you said at all. What he
did. Where he touched me. I didn't want it, Sally. The way
they said it, the way it's supposed to be, all the storybooks
and movies, why did you lie to me?
I was waiting by the red clowns. I was standing by the
tilt-a-whirl where you said. And anyway I don't like carnivals.
I went to be with you because you laugh on the tilta-whirl,
you throw your head back and laugh. I hold your
change, wave, count how many times you go by. Those
boys that look at you because you're pretty. I like to be
with you, Sally. You're my friend. But that big boy, where
did he take you? I waited such a long time. I waited by the red clowns, just like you said, but you never came, you
never came for me.
Sally Sally a hundred times. Why didn't you hear me
when I called? Why didn't you tell them to leave me alone?
The one who grabbed me by the arm, he wouldn't let me
go. He said I love you, Spanish girl, 1 love you, and pressed
his sour mouth to mine.
Sally, make him stop. I cou1,don't make them go away.
I couldn't do anything but cry. I don't remember. It was
dark. I don't remember. I don't remember. Please don't
make me tell it all.
Why did you leave me all alone? I waited my whole
life. You're a liar. They all lied. All the books and magazines,
everything that told it wrong. Only his dirty fingernails
against my skin, only his sour smell again. The moon
that watched. The tilt-a-whirl. The red clowns laughing
their thick-tongue laugh.
Then the colors began to whirl. Sky tipped. Their high
black gym shoes ran. Sally, you lied, you lied. He wouldn't
let me go. He said I love you, I love you, Spanish girl

Linoleum Roses

Sally got married like we knew she would, young and
not ready but married just the same. She met a marshmallow
salesman at a school bazaar, and she married him
in another state where it's legal to get married before eighth
grade. She has her husband and her house now, her pillowcases
and her plates. She says she is in love, but I think
she did it to escape.
Sally says she likes being married because now she
gets to buy her own things when her husband gives her
money. She is happy, except sometimes her husband gets
angry and once he broke the door where his foot went
through, though most days he is okay. Except he won't let
her talk on the telephone. And he doesn't let her look out
the window. And he doesn't like her friends, so nobody
gets to visit her unless he is working-.
She sits at home because she is afraid to go outside without his permission. She looks at all the things they own:
the towels and the toaster, the alarm clock and the drapes.
She likes looking at the walls, at how neatly their corners meet, the linoleum roses on the floor, the ceiling smooth
as wedding cake.

The Three Sisters

They came with the wind that blows in August, thin
as a spider web and barely noticed. Three who did not
seem to be related to anything but the moon. One with
laughter like tin and one with eyes of a cat and one with
hands like porcelain. The aunts, the three sisters, las comadres,
they said.
The baby died. Lucy and Rachel's sister. One night a
dog cried, and the next day a yellow bird flew in through
an open window. Before the week was over, the baby's fever
was worse. Then Jesus came and took the baby with him
far away. That's what their mother said.
Then the visitors came ... in and out of the little
house. It was hard to keep the floors clean. Anybody who
had ever wondered what color the walls were came and
came to look at that little thumb of a human in a box like
candy.
I had never seen the dead before, not for real, not in
somebody's living room for people to kiss and bless themselves
and light a candle for. Not in a house. It seemed
strange.
They must've known, the sisters. They had the power
and could sense what was what. They said, Come here, and
gave me a stick of gum. They smelled like Kleenex or the
inside of a satin handbag, and then I didn't feel afraid.
What's your name, the cat-eyed one asked.
Esperanza, I said.
Esperanza, the old blue-veined one repeated in a high thin voice. Esperanza ... a good good name.
My knees hurt, the one with the funny laugh complained.
Tomorrow it will rain.
Yes, tomorrow, they said.
How do you know? I asked.
We know.
Look at her hands, cat-eyed said.
And they turned them over and over as if they were
looking for something.
She's special.
Yes, she'll go very far.
Yes, yes, hmmm.
Make a wish.
A wish?
Yes, make a wish. What do you want?
Anything? I said.
Well, why not?
I closed my eyes.
Did you wish already?
Yes, I said.
Well, that's all there is to it. It'll come true.
How do you know? I asked.
We know, we know.
Esperanza. The one with marble hands called me aside. Esperanza. She held my face with her blue-veined
hands and looked and looked at me. A long silence. When
you leave you must remember always to come back, she
said.
What?
When you leave you must remember to come back
for the others. A circle, understand? You will always be
Esperanza. You will always be Mango Street. You can't
erase what you know. You can't forget who you are.
Then I didn't know what to say. It was as if she could
read my mind, as if she knew what I had'wished for, and
I felt ashamed for having made such a selfish wish.
You must remember to come back. For the ones who
cannot leave as easily as you. You will remember? She asked
as if she was telling me. Yes, yes, I said a little confused.
Good, she said, rubbing my hands. Good. That's all.
You can go.
I got up to join Lucy and Rachel who were already
outside waiting by the door, wondering what I was doing
talking to three old ladies who smelled like cinnamon. I
didn't understand everything they had told me. I turned
around. They smiled and waved in their smoky way.
Then I didn't see them. Not once, or twice, or ever
again.

Alicia & I Talking on Edna’s Steps

I like Alicia because once she gave me a little leather
purse with the word GUADALAJARA stitched on it, which
is home for Alicia, and one day she will go back there. But
today she is listening to my sadness because I don't have a
house.
You live right here, 4006 Mango, Alicia says and
points to the house I am ashamed of.
No, this isn't my house 1 say and shake my head as if
shaking could undo the year I've lived here. I don't belong. I don't ever want to come from here. You have a home,
Alicia, and one day you'll go there, to a town you remem­ber, but me I never had a house, not even a photograph ... only one I dream of.
No, Alicia says. Like it or not you are Mango Street
and one day you'll come back too.
Not me. Not until somebody makes it beucr.
Who's going to do it? The mayor?
And the thought of the mayor coming to Mango Street makes me laugh out loud.
Who's going to do it? Not the mayor.

A House of My Own

Not a Rat. Not an apartment in back. Not a man's
house. Not a daddy·s. A house all my own. With my porch
and my pillow, my pretty purple petunias. My books and my stories. My two shoes waiting beside the bed. Nobody
to shake a stick at. Nobody's garbage to pick up after.
Only a house quiet as snow, a space for myself to go,
clean as paper before the poem.

Mango Says Goodbye Sometimes

I like to tell stories. I tell them inside my head. I tell them after the mailman says, Here's your mail Here's your
mail he said.
I make a story for my life, for each step my brown
shoe takes. I say, ""And so she trudged up the wooden stairs,
her sad brown shoes taking her to the house she never
liked.""
I like to tell stories. I am going to tell you a story about
a girl who didn't want to belong.
We didn't always live on Mango Street. Before that
we lived on Loomis on the third floor, and before that we
lived on Keeler. Before Keeler it was Paulina, but what I remember most is Mango Street, sad red house, the house
I belong but do not belong to.
I put it down on paper and then the ghost does not
ache so much. I write it down and Mango says goodbye
sometimes. She does not hold me with both arms. She sets
me free.
One day I will pack my bags of books and paper. One
day I will say goodbye to Mango. I am too strong for her
to keep me here forever. One day I will go away.
Friends and neighbors will say, What happened to
that Esperanza? Where did she go with all those books and
paper? Why did she march so far away?
They will not know I have gone away to come back.
For the ones I left behind. For the ones who cannot out.2Embed"

Sometimes I feel like I've drifted, I feel different I feel gifted
I've been high so long, don't need to smoke to get lifted
I've been under pressure looking for Nikki
Whenever she is around, you know I come quickly
Vivid memories of Chicago, south side where I go
From Reggies to the House of Blues, progress is the motto
Man the first show that I ever done sold out was in Chicago
Yeah, yeah, living like I've been ready to die
Maybe not, I don't know why my mind is changing
Rearranging this dangerous melody, uh
Yeah, and I know that ain't nobody finna ever be ahead of me
All that competition right there is dead to me
Yeah, uh, yeah, I've been turning the pages
Feeling the vibe, shit is outrageous
Boy, I've been feeling courageous
This shit right here, I've been at it for ages
Feels like I'm running through mazes
Everybody has they phases
Yeah, vibe with this, bad bitch in the whip and I ride to this
And I'm feeling it uh, hope when I'm forty I'm still in it
One of the few that be killing it, uh
Yeah, young motherfucker that be giving what he living
On the road to success so you know that I'm driven
But they didn't wanna publish it
But right now I'm on some other shit
I'm in a different world, I'm with a different girl
I'm with the same team, but it's a different scheme
Remember back when I couldn't even pay the bills
And I'll never forget how that feels back when I would

Okay, doing what I gotta do, flying at this altitude
I look out the window like Goddamn, that's what I really do
Don't know why I fear the planes, sometimes I wish to sustain
If I look back on it I would do it all over again
Nikki, Nikki, where you been? I can't wait to breathe you in
Been on this plane way too long, I can't wait to see you again
Oh my God this turbulence has got me sippin' on this liquor
Crazy, racist, white bitch looking at us
Like, ""Who are these niggas?""
First class, on they ass, all complain that's when I dash
Just landed in Europe and this model bitch is tryna smash
Now I'm riding on the train, all this shit inside my brain
Just left a hotel in Belgium, damn them waffles was insane
Smoking blunts in Amsterdam

Okay, fuck affiliation, I'm that dude that did it on his own
These thoughts inside my mind be fuckin' with me when I'm all alone
I really like this girl she bad as fuck, why must I run away?
It feel like self assassination, I can't put this gun away
God damn, what's the plan? Not complacent where I am
Reminiscing when I hit the road back in that mini van
Broke as fuck, not a dollar, whipping that Chevy Impala
Praying that we make it out this city, Lord willin', Insha'Allah
Up to date the couple years, now my idols are my peers
I was on the road to nowhere till I decided to veer
Put my everything into this shit, you know, I know you know this
Used to give a fuck what people thought, hoping that they would notice
Stop giving a fuck cause music gotta be the only motive
Mind racing on and off the track, I'm going locomotive

Work so fucking much, my greatest fear is I'ma die alone
Every diamond in my chain, yeah, that's a milestone (I'm lovin' it!)
People calling me, askin' me for money, man (Uh)
The only thing I'ma give you motherfuckers is the dial tone (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Flashbacks of a youngin' sippin' that purple Kool-Aid
Skippin' school with my homies and chiefing reefer for two days
Running from the law, livin' how I'm livin', fuck 'em all
Bumping Triple Six
Hennessy in my cup, drivin' through the sticks
Who the bitch ridin' with me?
Man, the devil tryna get me
Motivated, under-educated, and hated
But finally gettin' cake like a happy belated
Bitch I made it, we on
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it
Write it, record it, mix it, master it, press it up, unveil it
Feel like I've been waitin' forever, forever to inherit
This is war, I declare it
Time is money, I can't spare it
Futuristic, so simplistic
Please decipher my linguistics
Slow it down, Robitussin
I'm the king, ain't no discussion
And now we blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion
My consumption is the illest
Section eight, I know you feel this
On the come up,  where they run up on you for nothin' at all
Brighter than eleven suns, this the first, where my funds?
EBT, that's the card
I thank God, I thank God, but it's hard
Uh, but it's hard

The only thing I'ma give you motherfuckers is the dial tone

[Verse 2]
God damn, god damn, we at it again
Me and my homies that know me blowing up like the Taliban
Yeah, my stress up, but I'm blessed up
Fuck around and get messed up
When I murder the rhyme, I'm livin' divine
You know that I'm one of a kind
Lemme get it right now, ho
Draped up and I'm dripped out (And I'm dripped out)
Right now, ho
Caked up 'til I cash out and I got 'em all wonderin', ""How so?""
On the down low, haters drown slow
On the down low, haters drown slow
Oh God, my God, we got it all right
Oh God, my God, we gotta get it, right?
These fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
I said these fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
Uh, tell me that they love me
Know damn well that they don't give a fuck
I be on that finger-flippin' killin' shit up in the cut
That's what's up
All these bitches out here tryna gas it up
This is everything I ever wanted, I can't pass it up
Life changed in a year, couldn't happen fast enough
""Can I do it like you do it?"" That's what they be askin' us
White Benz, black card, bitch better get your plastic up
Man, this shit is hella hard, but we never actin' up
Live it up, hold on to your dream, don't ever give it up
Finally had my share of success, and shit, I can't get enough
Now they know my name through the nation
'Cause my single like that good shit, man, always in rotation
Now they know Logic for Logic, not through my affiliations
Stackin' profit on profit, from this music I'm makin'
Even Jesus had haters, so when you feelin' forsaken
Tell 'em jealous Judases who this is, and man, that'll break 'em
And bitch, I'm still the same
Dash of autotune so y'all can feel the pain
Broke as fuck, back in that basement, not a dollar to my name
Chasin' fame, chasin' glory, 'til the day we make a story
Positive that life ain't mine, bitch you can take that shit to Maury
[Chorus]
Work so fuckin' much, my greatest fear is I'ma die alone
Every diamond in my chain, yeah, that's a milestone

The only thing I'ma give you motherfuckers is the dial tone

(Hello, no one is available to take your call)
I been workin' hard, I been searchin' for God
I been workin' hard, I been searchin' for God
(Please leave a message after the tone)
Little brother, this is yo' sister, you're busy, I get you
But I insist you call me back 'cause I miss you
I wish you well, well, I wish you would call
'Cause lately it feel like I’m just not yo' sister at all—all
Uh, I’m sorry for callin' and bawlin', I’m all in
And I feel like I'm fallin' lately, it feel like my children hate me
You tell me I'm beautiful and yet no man wanna date me
Haunted by vivid memories of that man who raped me
And lately I, I feel more and more like mommy, I know I’m me, but still
You always seemed to pick up the phone and somehow I feel
Better, but you been answerin' me lesser and lesser
So I resorted to the pills in my dresser, I'm gone
And as for... oh no, he left and he ain’t comin' back
I hate him and if I see him I swear I tell him that
No longer cookin' crack in my kitchen, cuttin' an' sellin' that
He broke my heart, that relationship been to hell and back
I been workin' hard, I been searchin' for God
I can feel the Devil around me as they all applaud
Promise you won't forget me, that you'll always be wit' me
And even when you gone I can call whenever he hit me
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure
[Verse 4]
Hey, son, this is your father, don't mean to bother
How are you? Heard you were in town, but I never saw ya
Tried to call ya, where are ya?
In Paris? What a beautiful destination
To perish right by the Eiffel, come now
Please don't be spiteful of all my small talk
I think we're overdue a long talk
When I see kids around the way, I say how I'm your dad
It gets me thinkin' 'bout incredible moments we've had
And on the real, I'm tryin' so hard not to bug you
But do you think you could stop rappin' about my drug use?
I'm two years clean, no longer a fiend
Yeah, I'm 57, but I feel 19
And I love you I swear, Bobby, I know you're there
And when the time is right I know that you gon' take care
Of anything I need, of yo' family
Can I have some tickets to your next show?
Would you stand wit' me?
Can I have some money for my new honey that's hella fine?
I forgot to mention I got divorced from yo' step-mom
My mind goin' crazy, but I still look hella calm
Maybe you could tell *beep*
I've been feelin' under pressure
[Interlude]
Hey, what's up, bro? This Ralph, I didn't want much, man, just calling to see what's going on. I know you're busy. Uh, Dad hit me up, it's his birthday today, but I know you know that. Uh, yeah, he calling, he be tryna introduce me to his new chick and stuff, man, I don't know how to handle that. I don't wanna tell him like nah, I ain't trying to meet her off top, you know? So what you think I should do? Text me, I know you're busy, dawg. But he been callin' me saying he wanna come down, he wanna bring his new chick and Brenda's like ""Damn, he really tryna rock out with his new chick"" 'cause you know we all fuck with Debbie. But I don't know, I don't know how to tell him this shit so just hit me back whenever you got the time, man, I know there's more shit on your plate. You ain't—you ain't gotta hit me, dawg, but if you do I'd appreciate it. When you back, love you, do your thing. Swag RattPack all day, boy. Alright, nigga, hit me
[Verse 5]
Uh, yeah, dear family, I'm so sorry that I've been distant
Everything changed in an instant, my time has been inconsistent
I know that you been insistin', I know that birthday I missed it
I swore I told my assistant, but I guess my mind is in another place
Thoughts off in another world, I started seein' another girl
It fell through, man, what a world
But I'm so focused on my craft, on employin' my staff
Such a perfectionist, I can't even finish this draft
This letter to the ones I love, the ones that I miss
Brothers and sisters that hit me up just to reminisce
Meanwhile, people outside of my blood askin' for favors
I don't owe you a fuckin' thing, you best switch yo' behavior
Truly remarkable how I barely know you, but somehow owe you When you don't even know 'bout the shit I go through, uh
We ain't spoken in a while, tell me sister, how yo' child?
Come now, girl, give me a smile, come on, girl, don't do me foul
Sorry I ain't call before, but I'm callin' you right now
I heard that you was poppin' E, stop resortin' to the vowel
How my mama, how she doin'? Does she know what I'm pursuin'?
I ain't talk to her in years, that relationship she ruined
But sometimes I wake up and wonder just what the fuck I'm doin'
They say family is everything, I swear that shit the truth
I should spend it all with y'all, but I spend it in the booth
This is everything I love, this is everything I need
Never sacrifice this feelin' even though my heart it bleed
This is everything I love, everything I need
Never sacrifice this feelin' even though my heart bleed
Under pressure, I've been feelin' under pressure

[Interlude]
Hey, son, I'm sorry I missed your call today, but I was in an AA meeting. Um, a friend of mine was celebrating four years so I couldn't get you right then. And then when I did call you, you weren't able to answer or whatever. Just wonderin' how things are going. Deb and I aren't together anymore, um... Livin' on my own, you know, um... Anyway, the whole family, even the family that you don’t know, my sisters and your aunts that you've never met are very proud of you. Your cousins just love you too. Anyway, son, I love you, I just want you to know that. And just keep grindin', you know? And um, I don't wanna hear you joinin' the Illuminati 'cause then I gotta kill ya. Hm-hm, I love you, son, bye482Embed"

It's been a minute since I've been with some women
Not 'cause they been lacking, just I've been lacking the feeling
I've been staring at the ceiling
Listening to the chat that they're revealing
Wondering if I open up or keep concealing
I ain't try to be demeaning, it seems
Thought you knew this, I don't really do this
Moving like a Judas
Talking all that talk but ain't no time for acting foolish
When you ask, all of the brothers saying, ""True, this""
I might just jump on this for free, jumpin' on them freestyle
I've been well, moving brain, senile
It's sole sunsets, beautiful is one guess
One morning afternoon in that sun dress
The summer flies by every morning, I'm still yawning
Same conversation, never boring
(""Yo, she texted you."" ""Swear?"" ""Nah, it's Tommo.""
""Ah, for fuck's sake!"")

Nothing will change until it drains, ain't nothing the same, uh
'Cause you become like the blood in my veins
Saying I'm way too young to be stuck on the rain
And still it's peak weeks 'til I figured out you played keys
Eighteen, you been listening to Jay Dee
Blaming the bait trees, telling me you hate these G's
But didn't need me telling you they ain't me
Because they ain't me, uh, they ain't me
Don't need to know about the colours that they paint me
I've been too busy getting dizzy off that JD
Dreaming of the places you could take me, so now I'm saying

Loyle Carner,Dear Jean,"17 ContributorsDear Jean Lyrics[Intro]
I think we got sixteen before, easily

[Verse]
Dear Jean
I hope this doesn't come as a surprise
But I've fallen for a woman from the skies
And she be truer than the lies
Truer than the prize
And you can see it when you look into her eyes
Deep blue like the flicker of the flame 'fore it dies
But this ain't dying, it's rising
Like the big round orange on horizon
I know it means I'm not about as much
But listen, I ain't moving out as such
Just moving half my clothes, maybe louder stuff
Out the south, out the house, never out of touch
Trust, I don't think I said it loud enough
I'm out the south, out the house, never out of touch
Trust, out of sight never out of mind
Out the light, never out of line
Trust, another night running out of time
Let it shine like we're living in a pantomime
She's not behind me or behind you
But beside we and beside two
But behind these little lines true
That I scribble in a book, think she idolizes you
So one night I'll be saying ""I do""
To a girl that can read my mind, too
With little Ryan sat in a white suit
With my own baby Jean sat to his right too
I had a dream and it came true
And I can only blame you

I was sat up on the train, starin' out the window at the rain
I heard this little lady must’ve felt the pain
Ask her mum if the blazin' sun'll ever shine again
I felt ashamed, feel the same, not her Mother though
Nah, started to laugh, got her son involved
Ah, mentioned the past like a runnin’ joke and told her, 'without all the rain, there's no stunning growth'
Close, ah, To everything and nothin'
Picture past the honeymoon and bluffin'
Where the wooden spoon is only cuffin'
Shortened the discussion
But the roots can't manoeuvre out of nothin’
I’ve been sufferin' these dreamy days, uh
Remedy and lust don’t hold any memories of us
Rather hold you everyday until the memories are dust
Yo, we only caught the train 'cause you know I hate the bus
Never get enough

(Aye) They ask about the bible I was readin'
Told them that the title was misleading
Labelled it Jerusalem but really it's for cookin’ Middle-Eastern
I could see her mind was changing
With the seasons
Shady for a reason
Uh, day will start decreasing
Leaving like the orange in the evenin'
It was creepin' through the clouds
But now I'm proud to see the images releasin'
I just wish the little lady could've seen it, but she was dreaming
(Ah) Reckon she's standin' with her mum saying to her
'Look, Mother here's the sun'
Rooted in the moment 'til the memories are done, so I sit and start to wonder
On the woman she'll become, wonder if I'll have a son or a daughter
Ones that I brought up never strong, never tellin' me to run
Never tryna find a sum
Tryna get it done
Yo, I wonder if she'd ever be as clever as her mum, one

Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was seven years old

[Verse 1]
It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven, smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure

[Chorus]
Once, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
""Go get yourself a wife, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was eleven years old

[Verse 2]
I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

[Chorus]
Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once, I was twenty years old (Lukas Graham!)

We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming

So I can sing them all my songs, and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry

Soon, I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month

Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?

[Verse 1]
Now I ain't trying to be the greatest
I used to hate hip-hop—yup, because the women degraded
But Too $hort made me laugh; like a hypocrite, I played it
A hypocrite, I stated, though I only recited half
Omitting the word ""bitch""—cursing, I wouldn't say it
Me and Dog couldn't relate 'til a bitch I dated
Forgive my favorite word for hers and hers alike
But I learned it from a song I heard and sort-of liked, yeah
Further, ice and glamorized drug dealing was appealing
But the block club kept it from in front of our building
Gangsta rap-based filmings became the building blocks
For children with leaking ceilings catching drippings with pots
Coupled with compositions from 'Pac
Nas's It Was Written, intermixed with my realities and feelings
Living conditions, religion, ignorant wisdom, and artistic vision
I began to jot, tap the world, and listen
It drop—

I was back to giving props again, and that was bothering
'Bout as uncomfortable as a Untouchable touching you
The theme songs that niggas hustled to seemed wrong
But these songs was coming true
And it was all becoming cool (Cool)
I found a condom on the ground that johns would cum into
And thought: ""What constitutes a prostitute is the pursuit of profit
Then, they drop it
The homie in a suit pat her on the butt, then rock it
It seems I was seeing the same scene adopted
Prevalent in different things with the witnesses indifferent to stop it
They said, ""Don't knock it, mind your business""

First got it when he was six, didn't know any tricks
Matter of fact, first time he got on it, he slipped
Landed on his hip and busted his lip
For a week he had to talk with a lisp, like thisss... (Ugh)
Now we can end the story right here
But shorty didn't quit, it was something in the air (Ugh)
Yeah, he said it was something so appealing
He couldn't fight the feeling, something about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it, couldn't understand it
Branded, since the first kickflip he landed, ugh (Woo)
Labeled a misfit, a bandit
Ka-kunk, ka-kunk, ka-kunk; his neighbors couldn't stand it
So, he was banished to the park
Started in the morning, wouldn't stop 'til after dark, yeah
When they said ""It's getting late in here
So I'm sorry, young man, there's no skating here""

And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be

[Bridge]
So let's kick... (Ugh)
And push (Y-yeah, y-yeah-yeah)
And coast
Uh, uh, uh (Y-yeah, y-yeah-yeah)

[Verse 2]
My man got a little older, became a better roller
Yeah, no helmet, hell bent on killing himself
Is what his mama said, but he was feeling himself
Got a little more swagger in his style
Met his girlfriend, she was clapping in the crowd
Love is what-what was happening to him now, ugh!
He said ""I would marry you
But I'm engaged to these aerials and varials
And I don't think this board is strong enough to carry two""
She said ""Bow! I weigh a hundred and twenty pounds"" (Woo!)
""Now, let me make one thing clear
I don't need to ride yours, I got mine right here""
So she took him to a spot he didn't know about
Some odd-end apartment parking lot
She said ""I don't normally take dates in here""
Security came and said ""I'm sorry, there's no skating here""
[Hook]
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
And away they roll
Just lovers intertwined with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push

So come and skate with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be

So let's kick (Ugh, ugh)
And push, yeah, yeah (Woo, woo)
And coast... (Yeah, ugh!)
(Haha, swanky)
Yeah, yeah!

[Verse 3]
Before he knew, he had a crew that wasn't no punk
In they Spitfire shirts and SB dunks
They would push 'til they couldn't skate no more
Office building lobbies wasn't safe no more
And it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing, they said (They said...)
An escape route they used to escape out
When things got crazy, they needed to break out
They'd head... to any place with stairs
Any good grinds, the world was theirs, ugh!
And their four wheels would take them there
Until the cops came and said, ""There's no skating here""
[Hook]
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
And away they rolled
Just rebels without a cause with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push

I know, I know but I gotta get up outta here, you know?
I gotta go pay these bills, I got a show to do, you know?
One time, for your mind
[Chorus]
Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago, man
Wherever I go she go

[Verse 1]
I love her, and I hate to leave her lonely
Ring-ring went the iPhone, it was my homie
He said, ""Let's hit Japan, if we can make 'em jam
We can make a hundred grand, spend it in the south of France""
Nothing further; I jumped, grabbed my Goyard trunk
Got ready to walk it out like Unk in my John Lennon Chucks
That's when I heard murder
""You're killing me, you're filling me with sorrow
Sunrise, goodbyes, and missing you tomorrows""
I turn to see my dream, love supreme queen
Meanest thing on the scene cry
I drop my bags in a flash, that's faster
Than 180 on that dash, shirt to dry her tears
And wipe the rain from my dear like Dasher
You's the dame who's the username to all my passwords
The reason I get fly is Ibn Jasper
I even keep your picture in my passport

[Verse 2]
So let's keep it real, all in together, ""Free Chill""
Tell the stewardess to throw a movie on the reel
Heat up my kosher meal, exchange my dollar bills
Lean back in my first class seat and sleep
Don't wake me 'til I land
Where they barely understand what I speak
But they nod to my beats
I tell my fans who I am and they stand
And they clap, they applaud, they love me, my God
Otsukaresama deshita, or maybe au revoir
A spree on Saint-Honoré, then back to Charles de Gaulle
So I can get home and tell her everywhere that I been, and
Everything that I done, and
Tell her that she's the one, and, umm

Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago, man
Then we can land in the motherland
Camel-back across the desert sand
And take a train, to Rome, or home

Wherever I go she goes

[Verse 3]
Guess who's back in the house
With a bunch of souvenirs and a smile for your mouth
I really missed you, each and every night I kissed you
In my dreams 'fore I went to sleep
To la-la land to count them sheep
I swear you're looking prettier than ever
It's got to be a prophecy for us to stay together, evermore
For better or, less or poor
Or worth our weight in buried treasure, X's on the shore
I know my world tour's like war to you
But Ian said, ""Aloha"", and Harley said, ""Cheers""
Julian said, ""Bonjour"", Big O was like, ""Yeah!""
Amanda and Le Messie want to know when we going there
Edison sends his love, so does the rest of the club
Of the international playboys and playgirls
But I revoke my membership, all for My Tenderness
She said, ""Pursue your interests 'cause even if I'm ticketless
I'll be there, by your side
In your heart, and on your mind""
So, as I taxi down another runway
I gotcha, who loves you bae
Now bring it back now

Bom, bom, bom, bom
Huh

[Verse 1: Jack Harlow]
Have you ever raised the value of everyone around you?
Have you ever been so high they got to down you?
Think pieces gettin' written about you
Have you ever been to Italy and eaten Italian?
Have you ever signed a deal that came with a medallion?
Have you ever booked the club and came with a battalion?
Have you been to Montana and seen the mountains?
Have you ever looked around and felt the profound sense of pride?
Have you ever had to hide where exactly you reside?
Have you been to the Waffle House on Northside?
Have you ever made a popstar wanna be your bride?
Have you hugged someone and they cried?
Have you had your heroes sit you down and give you the guide?
Have you ever spoken somethin' into existence
Or do you just talk about other people's lives?

[Chorus: Jack Harlow]

It's fine, victory's mine
I lost the desire for bein' intimate at the end of my nights
I can do that at the end of my life
You know the phrase is ""Business before pleasure""
'Cause I'm bankin' on it bringin' me more pleasure
The pressure makes diamonds, and diamonds make more pressure
And so on and so forth, okay, I'll give your four more measures
And more records with more effort than ever before
I'm the youngin' on the team that's got a veteran core
They know the formula, just give him space and let him record
And just remember what he said on the chorus

I know you feel love, feel shame, feel pride, I can see it in your eyes
I met a fan at work, he told me it's his job on the side
As if I'm unimpressed by his everyday life
Niggas die every day, B, that's everyday life
The women that you idolise can never play wife to me
When you done as many flights as me, long nights as me
Took as many left turns to make right as me
I'm in the middle of the Vale like a bride to be, that's why I like to (Bom, bom, bom, bom)
Yeah, you left somebody that you love at the bottom of a mountain
Cah they afraid to climb it, have you changed your climate?
Had her Insta' and made her change to private?
Had her fly economy and make her change to private?
Seen your nigga get nicked, and then go and catch a case just like him?
Brought her to the game and she ain't excited
Probably cah my mum sat courtside 'fore I did
Am I sick if I say I like women with mileage and trips to Knightsbridge?
Oh, Jemima, trips in the park with my oldest rider
To test out the .9 like I loaned a striker
I'm a lone survivor, and the way I spell lone is A-L-O-A-N
I don't ever wanna spend on a ho again
But I'm a fuckin' feminist, so I go again
I'm on the road again, yeah (Bom, bom, bom, bom)
You can't control what the heart feels
You soon go broke, I see you blowin' it fast still
Death row, you niggas down to your last meal
You ever signed a seven-figure deal in a bird's quill?
Can't even call it breakfast cah it wasn't your first mill'
Forgotten birthdays, but remember your verse still, yeah
You ever fucked a super model and it sounds like skeletons dancin'?
You feel numb to the praise and the memories passin'?
You ever robbed someone and it sounds like askin'?
Didn't have no food, so you'd disguise it as fastin'
Had drugs, abuse perfumes tryna mask it (Bom, bom, bom, bom)
You ever lived the life of an artist, escapin' darkness?
Fines and you're payin' for parkin'
You can tell how she fuck by the way that she glancin'
Your communication's bad, but you're rich, so she givin' you chances
And pretty women givin' you dances

[Intro]
(Just because I love you) Yeah, yeah
(Just because I love you) Ayy

[Verse 1]
Peel in my second whip
Stealing, putting second hand kills in my residence
Healed all my brethren with a seal, we can't let you in
Medicine
I put the effort in to still burn that effigy
Odorous, I'm sober, just as lil' as they letting me
Mama, wipe your tears, I'm fighting titans, can't invite you here
Poetic license veering from the mic, my chest too tight to steer
Chess lessons, bloodletting, flood when the night is clear
I ain't give a fuck 'til my lungs had to fight for air
Glaring, staring numb, therapist had a light to spare
Snatched me by the eye, said I'ma fight whether I like or not
And she told me reasons why, but that's the private part
Burnt the midnight lighter
Killed the drive in me to tie the knot
My game stop, but if I name-dropped you, you still got my heart
Driving off
Squeezing off the E-brake
These days, I can't talk to God just for my knees' sake
Long conversations to be had
Wrong places, wrong times, and strong patience I must add
Soul weighted, don't mistake expatiations for some sadness
Strong face, a long race, I'm unafraid to come in last
Quarter tank and ounce of gas and I'm driving
And it's just because I (Love you)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Just because I love you)

Arguing with mom 'cause I'm always gone when I stay here

That I see you out here poisoning yourself and want it for you
And I love you better than I love myself, my fruit is spoiled
And it's not a game, I put it in your name, I kinda told you""

[Verse 3]
Clasp the windows to my soul
Smoke thicken, grab my mental by the throat
Mind sifting, tides shift, it's still cement around my toes
Saran wrap around my pack, I can't trust get hand to hand
Served with a hand behind my back
They prayed for us
Ain't heard the answer but my glance is in the stash
It's growing handsome by the stack, I self-aggrandized in the past
But now the sun talking
Not sure of where I'm going, but I'm blunt-walking in life
Or in this hood, so keep a look for 911 callers
I fund loss 'cause I'm from loss
If you gut me, then no love lost
You spun me into crumbles, fingers numbing from the blood loss
I've endured
The moral of my story is I'm impure
The horror in my story is I've been through it and I still do it
And my pencil is in earnest
The difference 'tween you hearing the new records from my service
The medicine I'm burning turned my breath into a furnace
Whole face hot
Shoulders hold weight 'til I break pace and can't stop
So, baby, I could change your life if you let me
Tryna eat, ain't really crave a bite since gained insight from Desi
So I stay inside away from light
Hoping that your prayers reach
Loathing that I can't breathe
Croaking when I can't speak
Was open with my grand scheme
You was either with me or in my way, plow through standees
We sprouting, now we plant seeds
You plant love, love will grow
You plant fear, fear will grow
If you planted me, then me would grow
But I was branded negro
I got slighted before, relegated to pre-show
I started with wine, then to the clear, then to the Nino
And then to Everclear and never steering without pre-rolls
And I just had the presets to preceptor me, bro
I bleed presence and preach lessons, all for free, too
And I offer free smoke to any nigga behind a #MeToo
'Cause to my niggas, we ain't free until she free, too
And tell my sisters, we ain't free until they free, too, yeah

This sun don't shine when I'm alone
I lose my mind and I lose control
I see your eyes look through my soul
Don't be surprised, this all I know
I felt the highs and they feel like you
See, a love like mine is too good to be true
And you too divine to just be mine
You remind me of the color blue
Girl, I'm so in love with you, yeah

Baby, you were everything I ever wanted
Bought a wedding ring, it's in my pocket
Planned to ask the other day, knew you'd run away, so I guess I just forgot it
Remember when you went away to college?
Hours on the phone we end up talkin'
Past, present, future, all the gossip, goddamn
Puppy love ain't what it was, darlin'
Feelings that we have are so alarmin'
I can make you laugh, I can break the glass
If we made it last, it'd be a bargain
Mr. Charmin', that is my department
You was there before the fancy cars and
You was there when I was just a starvin' artist
When the car was havin' trouble startin'
Now we got our own apartment, same box for the mail
Same hamper for the laundry, the food in the fridge is stale
And this mornin', you cooked the eggs with the kale
I tried to hit it while you was gettin' dressed
You said, ""All you ever think about is sex""
I'm like, ""Oh well, you know me so well
And if this what make you late, I swear I won't tell
And every time I call your phone, you better pick up your cell
I swear to God I'ma freak out if it go straight to voice mail""
Well, I'm the jealous type, but I swear that ass is what Heaven's like
And when I'm in that pussy, it's a better life
That's the only way I'm tryna end the night
It's my only chance, I better get it right
[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Take your time, my baby
It's all waitin' for you, for you
I know I make your mind go crazy
But it's all waitin' right here for you, for you

[Outro: Bilal]
You would get close, I would run away
All I ever known is the color gray
Your loving ways bring me sunshine
I found an angel so divine (So divine)
Heaven probably not the same without you (Not the same)
But now you're in my world (In my world), in my world

Yeah, you know I love havin' a studio at home
Because right when I walk in the booth
You know I, I take a sip of my drink
You know like, light a cigarette and walk up to the mic
And it's exactly the correct height for me
That really just makes me feel comfortable
You know, lets the mind be at ease
And I, I noticed that, that uh, sometimes I, I rap with my Rollie on
And sometimes I take it off

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
You ain't gotta worry if you're cold
I promise, baby, I'll be there by tomorrow
From the beginnin', I'll be down for it all
'Cause I ain't seen nobody like you
And you looked so good when you walked by
I had to stop, you blew my high
A real angel bring you back to Earth
[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Hi, I'm sitting in the clouds
Everything around seems different to me now
And this could be a change for the both of us
Get away from the world that's controllin' us
It's only just me, I hope you trust me
You look a little nervous, keep adjusting
Your blouse that you got on
The buttons come undone
Let me know if you need me to put a fan on
I stand on the floor, 'bout to collapse
The bliss turns to war, heart turns to ash
Fun turns to drugs, the idea of cash
Has taken away my mind
And I think that it's a sign that
Your beauty handed me my mind back
My conscience, well, it tends to dissolve
I do some shit I won't remember at all

As you get lower than lowrider, your favorite ghostwriter
Could be jumpin' the gun (Gun), I might go over beyond

Hello, I would like to tell you about my love affair with my husband and the wonderful ways that we were able to understand each other, and find out about each other. We got to know each other little by little, living very close in the same building, and he would help me with things, and I would see him and think ""what a cute guy,"" and he was a cute guy. And it was just little by little, we got to know just to say hello. One day, I invited him to a party and I had heard so much about him, people respected him, and he was good to everybody he knew, people he worked with all adored him. And it was something so important. The respect that you have for somebody, for me, was the most important. Being attracted to him and being... finding people respected him and I respected him. I love the fact that he sensed how my feelings were, and I learned to understand and respect and see his feelings and understand his feelings ahead of time. So, it was so very easy to be together and look forward to being together and our love affair just blossomed the more we saw each other. And the more we were together, we learned more and more about each other. After a short period of time, we became engaged and had a very small intimate wedding with just family and very close friends, the friends we continued to have for the rest of our life. And then came two adorable little boys, and my husband just adored my daughter and adored the two boys. And I feel I just gave him a wonderful life, a good marriage and a wonderful family and I know he really had a beautiful life and I did too. And how important it is to love, respect and care for each other51Embed"

As the sun approached the meridian that day it became insufferably warm. Its hot rays scorched the ground. The earth almost blistered the foot that stood upon it. I was without coat or hat, standing bareheaded, exposed to its burning blaze. Great drops of perspiration rolled down my face, drenching the scanty apparel wherewith I was clothed. Over the fence, a very little way off, the peach trees cast their cool, delicious shadows on the grass. I would gladly have given a long year of service to have been enabled to exchange the heated oven, as it were, wherein I stood, for a seat beneath their branches. But I was yet bound, the rope still dangling from my neck, and standing in the same tracks where Tibeats and his comrades left me. I could not move an inch, so firmly had I been bound. To have been enabled to lean against the weaving house would have been a luxury indeed. But it was far beyond my reach, though distant less than twenty feet. I wanted to lie down, but knew I could not rise again. The ground was so parched and boiling hot I was aware it would but add to the discomfort of my situation. If I could have only moved my position, however slightly, it would have been relief unspeakable. But the hot rays of a southern sun, beating all the long summer day on my bare head, produced not half the suffering I experienced from my aching limbs. My wrists and ankles, and the cords of my legs and arms began to swell, burying the rope that bound them into the swollen flesh.

All day Chapin walked back and forth upon the stoop, but not once approached me. He appeared to be in a state of great uneasiness, looking first towards me, and then up the road, as if expecting some arrival every moment. He did not go to the field, as was his custom. It was evident from his manner that he supposed Tibeats would return with more and better armed assistance, perhaps, to renew the quarrel, and it was equally evident he had prepared his mind to defend my life at whatever hazard. Why he did not relieve me—why he suffered me to remain in agony the whole weary day, I never knew. It was not for want of sympathy, I am certain. Perhaps he wished Ford to see the rope about my neck, and the brutal manner in which I had been bound; perhaps his interference with another's property in which he had no legal interest might have been a trespass, which would have subjected him to the penalty of the law. Why Tibeats was all day absent was another mystery I never could divine. He knew well enough that Chapin would not harm him unless he persisted in his design against me. Lawson told me afterwards, that, as he passed the plantation of John David Cheney, he saw the three, and that they turned and looked after him as he flew by. I think his supposition was, that Lawson had been sent out by Overseer Chapin to arouse the neighboring planters, and to call on them to come to his assistance. He, therefore, undoubtedly, acted on the principle, that ""discretion is the better part of valor,"" and kept away.

But whatever motive may have governed the cowardly and malignant tyrant, it is of no importance. There I still stood in the noon-tide sun, groaning with pain. From long before daylight I had not eaten a morsel. I was growing faint from pain, and thirst, and hunger. Once only, in the very hottest portion of the day, Rachel, half fearful she was acting contrary to the overseer's wishes, ventured to me, and held a cup of water to my lips. The humble creature never knew, nor could she comprehend if she had heard them, the blessings I invoked upon her, for that balmy draught. She could only say, ""Oh, Platt, how I do pity you,"" and then hastened back to her labors in the kitchen.

Never did the sun move so slowly through the heavens—never did it shower down such fervent and fiery rays, as it did that day. At least, so it appeared to me. What my meditations were—the innumerable thoughts that thronged through my distracted brain—I will not attempt to give expression to. Suffice it to say, during the whole long day I came not to the conclusion, even once, that the southern slave, fed, clothed, whipped and protected by his master, is happier than the free colored citizen of the North. To that conclusion I have never since arrived. There are many, however, even in the Northern States, benevolent and well-disposed men, who will pronounce my opinion erroneous, and gravely proceed to substantiate the assertion with an argument. Alas! they have never drank, as I have, from the bitter cup of slavery. Just at sunset my heart leaped with unbounded joy, as Ford came riding into the yard, his horse covered with foam. Chapin met him at the door, and after conversing a short time, he walked directly to me.

""Poor Platt, you are in a bad state,"" was the only expression that escaped his lips.

""Thank God!"" said I, ""thank God, Master Ford, that you have come at last.""

Drawing a knife from his pocket, he indignantly cut the cord from my wrists, arms, and ankles, and slipped the noose from my neck. I attempted to walk, but staggered like a drunken man, and fell partially to the ground.

Ford returned immediately to the house, leaving me alone again. As he reached the piazza, Tibeats and his two friends rode up. A long dialogue followed. I could hear the sound of their voices, the mild tones of Ford mingling with the angry accents of Tibeats, but was unable to distinguish what was said. Finally the three departed again, apparently not well pleased.

I endeavored to raise the hammer, thinking to show Ford how willing I was to work, by proceeding with my labors on the weaving house, but it fell from my nerveless hand. At dark I crawled into the cabin, and laid down. I was in great misery—all sore and swollen—the slightest movement producing excruciating suffering. Soon the hands came in from the field. Rachel, when she went after Lawson, had told them what had happened. Eliza and Mary broiled me a piece of bacon, but my appetite was gone. Then they scorched some corn meal and made coffee. It was all that I could take. Eliza consoled me and was very kind. It was not long before the cabin was full of slaves. They gathered round me, asking many questions about the difficulty with Tibeats in the morning—and the particulars of all the occurrences of the day. Then Rachel came in, and in her simple language, repeated it over again—dwelling emphatically on the kick that sent Tibeats rolling over on the ground—whereupon there was a general titter throughout the crowd. Then she described how Chapin walked out with his pistols and rescued me, and how Master Ford cut the ropes with his knife, just as if he was mad.

By this time Lawson had returned. He had to regale them with an account of his trip to the Pine Woods—how the brown mule bore him faster than a ""streak o' lightnin""—how he astonished everybody as he flew along—how Master Ford started right away—how he said Platt was a good nigger, and they shouldn't kill him, concluding with pretty strong intimations that there was not another human being in the wide world, who could have created such a universal sensation on the road, or performed such a marvelous John Gilpin feat, as he had done that day on the brown mule.

The kind creatures loaded me with the expression of their sympathy—saying Tibeats was a hard, cruel man, and hoping ""Massa Ford"" would get me back again. In this manner they passed the time, discussing, chatting, talking over end over again the exciting affair, until suddenly Chapin presented himself at the cabin door and called me.

""Platt,"" said he, ""you will sleep on the floor in the great house to-night; bring your blanket with you.""
I arose as quickly as I was able, took my blanket in my hand, and followed him. On the way he informed me that he should not wonder if Tibeats was back again before morning—that he intended to kill me—and that he did not mean he should do it without witnesses. Had he stabbed me to the heart in the presence of a hundred slaves, not one of them, by the laws of Louisiana, could have given evidence against him. I laid down on the floor in the ""great house""—the first and the last time such a sumptuous resting place was granted me during my twelve years of bondage—and tried to sleep. Near midnight the dog began to bark. Chapin arose, looked from the window, but could discover nothing. At length the dog was quiet. As he returned to his room, he said,

""I believe, Platt, that scoundrel is skulking about the premises somewhere. If the dog barks again, and I am sleeping, wake me.""

I promised to do so. After the lapse of an hour or more, the dog re-commenced his clamor, running towards the gate, then back again, all the while barking furiously.

Chapin was out of bed without waiting to be called. On this occasion, he stepped forth upon the piazza, and remained standing there a considerable length of time. Nothing, however, was to be seen, and the dog returned to his kennel. We were not disturbed again during the night. The excessive pain that I suffered, and the dread of some impending danger, prevented any rest whatever. Whether or not Tibeats did actually return to the plantation that night, seeking an opportunity to wreak his vengeance upon me, is a secret known only to himself, perhaps. I thought then, however, and have the strong impression still, that he was there. At all events, he had the disposition of an assassin—cowering before a brave man's words, but ready to strike his helpless or unsuspecting victim in the back, as I had reason afterwards to know.

At daylight in the morning, I arose, sore and weary, having rested little. Nevertheless, after partaking breakfast, which Mary and Eliza had prepared for me in the cabin, I proceeded to the weaving house and commenced the labors of another day. It was Chapin's practice, as it is the practice of overseers generally, immediately on arising, to bestride his horse, always saddled and bridled and ready for him— the particular business of some slave—and ride into the field. This morning, on the contrary, he came to the weaving house, asking if I had seen anything of Tibeats yet. Replying in the negative, he remarked there was something not right about the fellow— there was bad blood in him—that I must keep a sharp watch of him, or he would do me wrong some day when I least expected it.

While he was yet speaking, Tibeats rode in, hitched his horse, and entered the house. I had little fear of him while Ford and Chapin were at hand, but they could not be near me always.

Oh! how heavily the weight of slavery pressed upon me then. I must toil day after day, endure abuse and taunts and scoffs, sleep on the hard ground, live on the coarsest fare, and not only this, but live the slave of a blood-seeking wretch, of whom I must stand henceforth in continued fear and dread. Why had I not died in my young years—before God had given me children to love and live for? What unhappiness and suffering and sorrow it would have prevented. I sighed for liberty; but the bondman's chain was round me, and could not be shaken off. I could only gaze wistfully towards the North, and think of the thousands of miles that stretched between me and the soil of freedom, over which a black freeman may not pass.

Tibeats, in the course of half an hour, walked over to the weaving-house, looked at me sharply, then returned without saying anything. Most of the forenoon he sat on the piazza, reading a newspaper and conversing with Ford. After dinner, the latter left for the Pine Woods, and it was indeed with regret that I beheld him depart from the plantation.

Once more during the day Tibeats came to me, gave me some order, and returned.

During the week the weaving-house was completed —Tibeats in the meantime making no allusion whatever to the difficulty—when I was informed he had hired me to Peter Tanner, to work under another carpenter by the name of Myers. This announcement was received with gratification, as any place was desirable that would relieve me of his hateful presence.

Peter Tanner, as the reader has already been informed, lived on the opposite shore, and was the brother of Mistress Ford. He is one of the most extensive planters on Bayou Boeuf, and owns a large number of slaves.

Over I went to Tanner's, joyfully enough. He had heard of my late difficulties—in fact, I ascertained the flogging of Tibeats was soon blazoned far and wide. This affair, together with my rafting experiment, had rendered me somewhat notorious. More than once I heard it said that Platt Ford, now Platt Tibeats—a slave's name changes with his change of master—was ""a devil of a nigger."" But I was destined to make a still further noise, as will presently be seen, throughout the little world of Bayou Boeuf.

Peter Tanner endeavored to impress upon me the idea that he was quite severe, though I could perceive there was a vein of good humor in the old fellow, after all.
""You're the nigger,"" he said to me on my arrival —""You're the nigger that flogged your master, eh? You're the nigger that kicks, and holds carpenter Tibeats by the leg, and wallops him, are ye? I'd like to see you hold me by the leg—I should. You're a 'portant character—you're a great nigger—very remarkable nigger, ain't ye? I'd lash you—I'd take the tantrums out of ye. Jest take hold of my leg, if you please. None of your pranks here, my boy, remember that. Now go to work, you kickin' rascal,"" concluded Peter Tanner, unable to suppress a half-comical grin at his own wit and sarcasm.

After listening to this salutation, I was taken charge of by Myers and labored under his direction for a month, to his and my own satisfaction.

Like William Ford, his brother-in-law, Tanner was in the habit of reading the Bible to his slaves on the Sabbath, but in a somewhat different spirit. He was an impressive commentator on the New Testament. The first Sunday after my coming to the plantation, he called them together, and began to read the twelfth chapter of Luke. When he came to the 47th verse, he looked deliberately around him, and continued— ""And that servant which knew his lord's will,""—here he paused, looking around more deliberately than before, and again proceeded—""which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself""—here was another pause—""prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.""

""D'ye hear that?"" demanded Peter, emphatically. ""Stripes,"" he repeated, slowly and distinctly, taking off his spectacles, preparatory to making a few remarks.

""That nigger that don't take care—that don't obey his lord—that's his master—d'ye see?—that 'ere nigger shall be beaten with many stripes. Now, 'many' signifies a great many—forty, a hundred, a hundred and fifty lashes. That's Scripter!"" and so Peter continued to elucidate the subject for a great length of time, much to the edification of his sable audience.

At the conclusion of the exercises, calling up three of his slaves, Warner, Will and Major or, he cried out to me—

""Here, Platt, you held Tibeats by the legs; now I'll see if you can hold these rascals in the same way, till I get back from meetin'.""

Thereupon he ordered them to the stocks—a common thing on plantations in the Red River country. The stocks are formed of two planks, the lower one made fast at the ends to two short posts, driven firmly into the ground. At regular distances half circles are cut in the upper edge. The other plank is fastened to one of the posts by a hinge, so that it can be opened or shut down, in the same manner as the blade of a pocket-knife is shut or opened. In the lower edge of the upper plank corresponding half circles are also cut, so that when they close, a row of holes is formed large enough to admit a negro's leg above the ankle, but not large enough to enable him to draw out his foot. The other end of the upper plank, opposite the hinge, is fastened to its post by lock and key. The slave is made to sit upon the ground, when the uppermost prank is elevated, his legs, just above the ankles, placed in the sub-half circles, and shutting it down again, and locking it, he is held secure and fast. Very often the neck instead of the ankle is enclosed. In this manner they are held during the operation of whipping.

Warner, Will and Major, according to Tanner's account of them, were melon-stealing, Sabbath breaking niggers, and not approving of such wickedness, he felt it his duty to put them in the stocks. Handing me the key, himself, Myers, Mistress Tanner and the children entered the carriage and drove away to church at Cheneyville. When they were gone, the boys begged me to let them out. I felt sorry to see them sitting on the hot ground, and remembered my own sufferings in the sun. Upon their promise to return to the stocks at any moment they were required to do so, I consented to release them. Grateful for the lenity shown them, and in order in some measure to repay it, they could do no less, of course, than pilot me to the melon-patch. Shortly before Tanner's return, they were in the stocks again. Finally he drove up, and looking at the boys, said, with a chuckle,—

""Aha! ye havn't been strolling about much to-day, any way. I'll teach you what's what. I'll tire ye of eating water-melons on the Lord's day, ye Sabbath-breaking niggers.""

Peter Tanner prided himself upon his strict religious observances he was a deacon in the church.

But I have now reached a point in the progress of my narrative, when it becomes necessary to turn away from these light descriptions, to the more grave and weighty matter of the second battle with Master Tibeats, and the flight through the great Pacoudrie Swamp.Embed"

These motherfuckers can feel that the storm is comin'
I’ve been broke to the point that I couldn’t afford to hustle
If you listen to my music you're welcome to join the struggle
I got the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I’m building muscle!
Take a look into my eyes and you can see the ambition
I’m feelin' imprisoned, it’s obvious to see you don’t get it
I think it’s time for you to really start readin' my lyrics
And you can see that I’m a whole different breed and appearance
Don’t need a reason to kill it, motherfucker I just do it
If opportunity knocks at my door, I run through it
This a whole another level of hustle, so fuck you
If you don’t play this shit at night all alone and get drunk to it
Gotta conquer and divide and put your heart on the line
I’ll never work a 9-5, bitch I want what is mine
That’s the difference, I’ll never be a slave to the system
And you ain't ballin' dawg your momma had to pay your tuition
I’m throwin' molotov’s at all of y’all, I play my position
I put this blade to your face 'til my name is imprinted
It cuts deep, you should probably give the surgeon a call
'Cause every word and every bar leaves a permanent scar
Back on a hiatus, old school like Miles Davis
Told my grandpa stick around I promise you won't make it
It’s been a long time since I felt calm and collected
And to be honest it’s been fuckin' with my confidence levels
When I was little I was convinced that I am the devil
Now the devil is my bitch wearin' five inch stilettos
Put in workin' so long, it feels like I need a medal
Got these rappers on my strings, I feel like I am Geppetto

Cut off your lip gloss with jigsaws and spit on you

When they whack as shit
I dealt the cards I was given, I ain't asked for this
I ain't that convinced what you rap you actually did
No one's fuckin' with me, put 'em in front of me please

by Marian Van Court

Originally published in The Eugenics Bulletin, Spring 1983

Most people are surprised to discover the prevalence of unwanted births in this country and the extent to which they are inversely related to intelligence and educational level. Approximately one-fifth of the births between 1960-1965 in a U.S. sample were said by the parents to have resulted from unplanned, unwanted pregnancies; two-fifths of the remainder were also accidental, but claimed to have been intended for some future time (Bumpass and Westoff, 1970). These figures tend to underestimate the total percentage of unwanted births because there is ""considerable rationalization"" in parents' reporting, and because illegitimate births are not counted.

In this same study, the incidence of unwanted births war negatively related to both educational level and income. The proportion was twice as high among wives with less than a high school education compared to that of wives with at least some college (26% vs. 13%). The proportion was twice as high for families with incomes under $3000 than for families with incomes over $10,000. For every category of education and income, the percentage was higher for blacks than for whites. For blacks as a whole, more than one-third of the births to married couples were unwanted (Bumpass and Westoff, 1970).

During the 1970's, there was a dramatic increase in usage of the most effective birth control methods-""the pill'', the IUD and sterilization (Westoff & Ryder, 1977). In 1976, unwanted marital fertility had declined to 12% (USDHEW, 1980). But the rate of illegitimate births (most of which could be presumed to be unwanted) had more than tripled since the early '60's. By 1979, 9% of white births and 49% of black and ""other"" births were out-ofwedlock (Bureau of the Census, 1979). Significant differences by education and income remained.

Part of the problem is that those of low educational level are less likely to use contraception. Yet even among a sample of women using the same highly-effective methods, those with lower IQs were found to have much higher failure rates. Percentages having unwanted births during a three-year interval were 3%, 8% and 11% for high, medium and low IQ women, respectively. For those not using one of these methods, the percentages were 15%, 23 and 31% (Udry, 1978). After an unwanted pregnancy has occurred, higher IQ couples are more likely to obtain abortions (Cohen, 1978). Unmarried teenage girls who become pregnant are more likely to carry and deliver a baby than to have an abortion if they are doing poorly in school (Olson, 1980). Thus each factor--from initially employing some form of contraception, to successful implementation of the method, to termination of an accidental pregnancy when it occurs--involves selection against intelligence.

A pathbreaking study by Vining (1982) has reported a negative correlation between fertility and intelligence for a large, representative sample in the U.S. aged 24-35 as of the late 1970's. My own research (Van Court, manuscript in preparation) has replicated Vining's results on a broader age range. Unwanted births undoubtedly make a contribution to this dysgenic trend, although no study (to my knowledge) has yet precisely quantified their impact.

Fertility studies usually include information about socio-economic status and educational level, which can be used as proxies for IQ, but are not ideal measures. As mentioned above, there are problems with reluctance of parents to admit to contraceptive failures, which introduce unreliability into calculations of unwanted births. Perhaps the main impediment has been the environmentalist milieu of the past several decades which has relegated vital research questions such as these to a not-entirely-benign neglect.

Despite the unfortunate lack of exact figures on the effect of unwanted births on the dysgenic trend in the U.S., inferences can be drawn from various data which indicate the impact is substantial. Several studies which reported the usual negative correlation between number of children and educational level and income found zero correlation, or even a tiny positive correlation, when only planned families were analyzed (Kiser and Whelpton, 1953; Freedman and Slesinger, 1961).

As an aside, it should be mentioned that while a great deal of attention has been paid to ""excess fertility'' and its implications for the problem of overpopulation, very little attention has been paid to the opposite problem of ""deficit fertility"". It was first analyzed by Weller and Chi (1973), and again on a larger sample by Weller (1974), who found that 18% of American women said they desire more children than they expect to have. Highly educated women were more likely to fall into the ""deficit fertility"" category. The reasons for this definitely warrant closer examination. Weller also found the usual negative relationship between the wives education and unwanted births.

Prevention of unwanted births could well be considered a worthwhile humanitarian goal in itself, aside from its important eugenic consequences. A great deal of individual human misery could be alleviated for parents and for children if only planned births occurred. Unwanted children are reported to be more often subjected to neglect and physical abuse, and to suffer more frequently from emotional problems (Lebensohn, 1973). Prevention of unwanted births would yield collective economic benefits as well--the number one cause of dependence upon Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC, the largest category of welfare) is accidental, unwanted births (Bogue, 1975; ""Unplanned Pregnancy..."", 1981).

For many people, a major reluctance to confronting the crucial question of the current direction of human evolution stems from an uncomfortable suspicion that it might well be unfavorable, and from the allied conviction that if indeed the evidence proves we are deteriorating genetically, no morally and socially acceptable solutions exist. An almost primitive fatalism and superstition underly the assumption that as a society we are utterly powerless to alter our course, however disastrous a legacy we may be leaving future generations through our negligence, and the irrational fear that if we dare attempt to guide it (or even if we think about it too much!) we run a grave risk of being suddenly forced against our wills through some mysterious, outrageously implausible yet inexorable sequence of events culminating in genocide and World War III. I am pleased to report that this need not be the case!
The fact that some substantial portion of current dysgenic reproduction is attributable to unwanted births points squarely to a set of remedies which would be acceptable to most people, both morally and socially: 1. greater efforts in the area of sex education for adolescents, 2. increased availability of permanent birth control methods for couples who have achieved their desired family size, and 3. most important, more equal access to abortion as a safety net when other methods fail. ""More equal access"" necessarily means liberalization of abortion laws and government support for those who want abortions but can't afford to pay for them. It seems most improbable that the vociferous ""Pro-Life"" faction will ever succeed in totally banning all abortions against the desires of the majority of Americans. Therefore, abortions must be equally obtained by all segments of society unless they are to act as a selective agent. At present, abortions are more readily obtained by those with money, education, intelligence and initiative. Thus the effect is to decrease our genetic potential for these and associated positive traits. Ideally abortions would act automatically as a selective agent in a eugenic rather than a dysgenic way. Since women of low IQ fail more often with birth control and thus have more unwanted pregnancies, if all women with unwanted pregnancies had abortions, this would neutralize the dysgenic effect of birth control failure. Few political conservatives (or liberals, for that matter) are actively searching for more government programs on which to spend taxpayers' dollars. But the alternative in this case--even viewed solely from a short-term standpoint--is even worse. It is obviously far more expensive for a woman on welfare to deliver a baby than to have an abortion, not to mention the costs of supporting the child for 18 years.

In Japan, where eugenic considerations are written into law, abortions are easily obtained and are very inexpensive (Muramatsu, 1967). As a consequence, obtaining one does not present an insurmountable obstacle to the unintelligent, the uneducated, the extremely passive or the indigent. If this became the situation in the United States, if the slogan ""Every child a planned child"" became a reality, it could go a long way towards eliminating the unhealthy negative relationship between intelligence and fertility which now exists.

Yo, uh, yo, y-yo, yo, y-yo

[Verse 1]
It could all be so simple (Ba-ba-ba-baby, baby, baby)
But you'd rather make it hard (Huh, uh)
Loving you is like a battle (It's like a battle)
And we both end up with scars

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me who I have to be (Who I have to be)
To get some reciprocity
See, no one loves you more than me (More than me)
And no one ever will (No one ever will, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Is this just a silly game (Silly game)
That forces you to act this way? (To act this way)
Forces you to scream my name
Then pretend that you can't stay (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me, who I have to be (I know what we gotta do)
To get some reciprocity
See, no one loves you more than me
And no one ever will
You might also like[Chorus]
No matter how I think we grow
You always seem to let me know
It ain't working (It ain't working, no), it ain't working
And when I try to walk away
You'd hurt yourself to make me stay
This is crazy, this is crazy (Oh, this is crazy, uh-huh)
[Verse 3]
I keep letting you back in (You back in)
How can I explain myself? (I don't understand why)
As painful as this thing has been
I just can't be with no one else

[Pre-Chorus]
See I know what we've got to do (Yeah)
You let go (You let go), and I'll let go too (And I'll let go)
Cause no one's hurt me more than you (No one's hurt me more than you)
And no one ever will

[Chorus]
No matter how I think we grow
You always seem to let me know
It ain't working (It ain't working), it ain't working (It ain't working)
And when I try to walk away
You'd hurt yourself to make me stay
This is crazy, (This is crazy) Oh, this is crazy (This is crazy)

Ms. Lauryn Hill,I Gotta Find Peace of Mind - Live,"3 ContributorsDizaster vs. Real Sikh Lyrics[Round 1: Real Sikh]
We got a lot of ground to cover
But before we get started...you ain't on a good path
Akhi to Akhi, you ain't been talkin' the way that you should have
I gotta check you, I don't care how many Grapes gave you a hood pass
Stop sayin' the ""n word"", you makin' us look bad
Ya name ""Bachir""
You don't see you disrespectin' the culture when you take it there?
Got accepted as a guest, got too comfy now he behaving weird
You said it like nine times on King of The Dot
Did you stop? Make it clear
I mean you be lettin' it fly on IG Live, tough guy, say it here
I dare you to try to do it
Boy I just bought a nеw foldin' chair and I'm dyin' to use it
Or a big barrel, watch your mouth or be watchin' through it
Trauma unit, or thе mortician fill his corpse with liquid 'til the bobby loosen
Drop an ""n bomb"" and you end up in embalming fluid

Yeeeeah! Welcome to URL bitch!

We are not the same, even on the map
Let me give a quick lesson
I'm from North India, Binjai
He from Lebanon, different section
In the middle of our countries, it's just miles of sand, it's been measured
So the only thing you see between the Sikh and an Arab? Big Desert
We not the same
This'll answer any kind of question of why we separate
We got the gas stations, but they the reason why the oil supply expensive
This 5 star Uber versus the ones that's drivin' reckless
Turbans to Hijab collections
Convenient stores : pilot lessons
7/11 : 9/11
Now it's time to fuck him up, I punch then I reconnect
That's a Middle Eastern combo like humus and pita bread
This was barely two weeks of prep cause his league in debt, he need the bread
What's that league? GTX?
Well this gon' be an easy (Eazy) death
Stomach shot, he breathin' less
Swing? I squeeze the TEC
If I get hit by Dizaster (disaster), he get bucks back, that's a FEMA check
He leavin' dead
Have him shook with a heater beside him
That shit low key scary, like sneezing and drivin'
Got me a handgun, get rocked in ya man bun
Said a disaster (Dizaster) on it's way, I'm stockin' the cans up
This is all haymakers to make this whole round work
Cause when a disaster (Dizaster) in town, the power lines go out first
What? You gonna make fun of my style? And how it seems so fast?
Bad move, cause that's exactly how he gon' rap
And I'ma still biggity, biggity beat yo' ass!
I ride with a tool
Bitch you gon' be liver than who?
The shotty Geechi Gotti, it'll body you outta the blue
Shot his medulla oblongata, chop his mind into food
It'll turn the top of his roof into baba ganoush
Bitch you not a disaster (Dizaster) you was dead before the wind blew
Chopper like an earthquake you never gon' live through
Gotta use the Richter Scale just to measure when it hits you
It'll have Dizaster (disaster) underground with a 7.62
Brandish it
A Kalashnikov with a damagin' banana clip
Drivin' to his crib in Los Angeles
Out the window, handin' him
Bullets then I dash errrrr
Start pullin' out his pad like Canibus
We gotta cancel him
Why on URL you never had a grade A performance?
Wait, wait?
You know what rhymes with ""grade A performance?""
""No haymaker moments""
""No main stage opponents""
""You ain't great or GOAT'ed""
""They takin' notice""
""Them Grapes ain't ya homies""
""Take an AK then load it""
Or a beam on the Glock, stay laser focused
Grab your Bae face then hold it
Barrel in her throat, have her neck lookin' like a snake ate a rodent
Bitch we know that you can rap, you just be doin' wack shit
And to get it out the way, I wasn't influenced by your style
I was influenced by dudes like Magic, Crooked I, Big L, Big Pun, Kool G Rap shit
True student of the craft Diz'
You ain't influence that shit, you a has been
The main difference with us two in battlin'
Is I'm you if you respected where you was at and you adapted
My resume here? Mostly legends
I showed and proved
Welcome to URL pussy, don't get boo'd!
Jersey!

Now you right Sikh, I haven't been on the right path
Recently I've been puttin' on for the scene and gettin' love from everybody
Then all of a sudden I called out a couple clowns and people started throwin' dirt on me
Now I feel like Hollow at the face off cause it's crazy how all of a sudden the tables turned on me
When Beas' first hit me up to book this
He said, ""Now I know you don't have enough time to prepare and I'm aware of this
The money is good so you can call up Sikh on the phone, discuss the time limits and how you gon' prepare for it.""
And I said, ""First of all. I don't negotiate with terrorists.""
At first I took too long to respond, he started gettin' arrogant
He told Beas, ""I don't even wanna see his face. Just tell me when you take care of it.""
And I was like, ""Damn! This guy handles his battles like his arranged marriages.""
If you Real sick (Sikh) than I'm very sick, I bury shit
Big Arab shit, I came all the way down to Houston with a bunch of Rockets under my wing like Larry Smith
Yeah, you got a big bow you shoot your arrows with
Bitch I'm Arabic, so even when it's war time we rarely flinch
You can catch me singin' through Armageddon like Aerosmith
Now that's first of all
Now second of all, I will beat your little large ass the fuck up!
God damn on camera, you look tall and buff as shit
You gotta be kidding me
This guy's a midget in real life, what the fuck is this?
I'm a legend, me, I can't eat off this
This must be what it's like in real life when you order the Iron Sheik off Wish
Fuck that, it's like Smack ordered ME off Wish
I said, low prep time, I knew this would be do or die with him
They say, ""You can't kill a man who's ready to lose his life, but you can try with him.""
With that being said, there ain't shit he can do to me
Cause I've already accepted this battle as my suicide mission
Now that I got that out the way, you gon' get this work falafel face
Before I go any further I'ma need your small large ass to sit down
Got a bunch of important shit to get out, I'ma do it in this round
Ayo Eazy!
Look who's the bitch now
Oh I bet your stomach is turnin' watchin' me burn you in front of this big crowd
Do you believe in a Parallel Universe?
(I DO!)
It's crazy, how we're in two different locations but we're both getting Real Sikh (sick) now
They say, ""Dizaster is the one that switched."" How?
Y'all the motherfuckers that wanted that shit
You just mad that I'm on the biggest stage in the world and next week you gonna be battlin' on Summer Sadness
{Crowd boos. Dizaster loses his spot for a minute}

I guess I did too much of that and I gotta find a different way to approach you
I figured for all the work you put in on URL, all the pain you must go through
You can't make none of these cards on your own, Smack ready to disown you
Cause when it comes to sellin' out these big stages, you New Era cats ain't got the type of talent he can go to
All you good for is being spoiled brats, gettin' up in his face and actin' like he owes you
So even you in a new student, you still stuck in the class below you
That's why Smack put you on the back burner and put your bitch ass to home school (Home Skool)
Man, does this dude have an attitude or somethin'
I will smack dude actin' like a lab mutant buggin'
I will smack you with the Papoose backhand and ya ass doin' nothin'
I will stash you and your half human cousins in a tandoori oven
I will pull an axe out, I will hack you up with somethin'
Bag him up and dump him
He'll be like Nipsey Hustle, they gon' find the other half of you in London
You wanna know how I battle?
Okay, why is it that all these Sikh guys look like they were born naturally wearing eye shadow?
This guy is like the White Castle of rhyme battles
Now-a-days you only see his little goofy ass on iBattle cause he wins once in every like five battles
You can catch him online cryin' how ""I didn't have enough time for the Shine battle
Tryin' to find balance in-between a famous recording artist and taking care of my camel, my mind's scrambled.""
I feel like I'm battlin' me from my past life, and just to get here I had to time travel
Cause this dude, his whole life he's been livin' in my 5 o'clock shadow
He gonna go for a Math angle
He been going for low hangin' fruit since day one
Now all a sudden, Osama Bin fuckin' Laden wants me to catch a fair one
{Crowd starts getting restless}

That wrap on your head ain't even Islamic

{Diz to the crowd}
[Diz] Shut up! Do you guys wanna hear this shit or not?""
[Crowd] No!
[Diz] Fuck you!
[Smack] Hold it down
[Diz] I'ma still repeat it. It fucked up my whole round, but I'ma repeat it. I'm goin, I'm goin'. I ain't stoppin'. I'm goin'. Y'all aren't doin' this. Y'all aren't going to do this to me. Nope!

Now all a sudden, Osama Bin fuckin' Laden wants me to catch a fair one
That wrap on your head ain't even Islamic
It's a bonnet
This bitch ain't got her hair done
You look like Jaz when she wakes up
Ms. Hustle when she 'bout to go to bed and take off her make-up
I'll slap that dishrag off of your head like Pat Stay but
I'll also step back and throw in a blade cut
The doctors will have to stitch the top of your head and your face up 'til it looks like a lace front
Bitch it's a wrap, I'm wiggin' on him, all your stories are made up
I seen your last battle in Houston you ain't got shit but crickets so I don't want this to come off as hate but
Since y'all don't react to my shit today I might as well blow this whole fuckin' place up
He's like, ""Nah Diz, you can't. I'm not a terrorist. I'm sorry Diz, I'm not a terrorist
Me and my people we not Iranian/Arabians and it's bad for you to do that to your culture and make the comparison.""
You right bitch, we don't share the same heritage
Cause y'all some computer geeks, network freaks
When we talkin' networks, our shit get that deep
I'm talkin' AK's, we can get that
Artillery? We can get that
Grenade launchers come in ten packs each
I got enough 'Arab Money' on his head I can dead that beef
And even after I spend that, I'll still have a lot of money left for the Rockets like Fred Vanvleet
Bitch your spicy fuckin' crib smells like a dead man's feet
And I heard your fuckin' uncle got engaged to your step-dad's niece and she got yellow ass teeth
Me and you look the same, why do we have beef?
There's too few of us around, we should just have peace
Plus I'm from the Middle East so you know I got the connect to get you those headwraps cheap

Time. Fuck it. Fuck y'all

[Round 2: Real Sikh]
Before we get started can y'all repeat after me, Long Live Pat Stay
(Long Live Pat Stay!)
That was my dawg man, I still ain't get past the news
We raised a quarter mil' for your fam' homie, still crazy I got to battle you
I know you proud watchin' this event
Shit, even you and Dizaster's cool
It was an honor being your last battle on SMACK, not it's 'bout to be your last one too
You said, you're not a guest in this culture and this is your culture
Y'all condoning this?
(No!)
Bitch you wouldn't be shit in this culture if they didn't allow you to have a voice in it
My identity and my name, I don't act different, everyone know I'm Sikh
But you? Dependin' on who you hang around, your persona switch
On the west coast he Crip
King Of The Dot he do that scientific multi shit
On SMACK he holdin' clips
In other countries he a foreign kid
Everything you do is backwards, no one told you this?
You appropriate the culture and only rep your culture when it's appropriate
You a vulture Diz!
And Eazy 30'd you, put ya fame through the roof
You lost in the buildin' at your event, that made this lame lose his cool
He lost in The Bay
In The Bay?!
They knew it too
How you from Lebanon and we ain't see The Bay root (Beirut) for you
Nobody hate you because of your race, we hate you for you
He lose all control and be screamin'
Talkin' 'bout this NDA that he got but no one believe it
Them lies you told is misleadin'
You like rhymes, right? You know what rhyme with ""Non Disclosure Agreement""?
""You Not Supposed To Be Speakin'""
Shhhh
Now I gotta make him shut the fuck up and chalk him out, have your fam' speechless
How does cuttin' your organs sound?
'Til the blood will be pourin' out
And I don't need no N.D.A. when I do somethin' unspeakable there's nothin' to talk about
Watch ya mouth
I don't hesitate if he talkin' trash
Wuhan, China
When I start disaster (Dizaster), it's off the bat
You thought the vaccine ain't work, and shit, you didn't lie
Cause they gave you a shot, and you got Real Sikh (sick) and died
You up here heavy breathin', stutterin' and shit
Your raps ain't clear
You battled in Arabic, Spanish, Russian, and the fans ain't care
Ain't touched URL in the last eight years
Cause no matter how many languages you speak you don't translate here
You ain't great on this side cause how outdated your style is
Tryin' to be complicated with rhymin' so on stages you dyin'
Shit is different over here, haymakers be shinin'
Keep rhymin' a bunch of words, you just wastin' our time
This shit is different, it ain't comedy, it's a dangerous environment
How you the future Dizaster (disaster)? You ain't notice the change in the climate
You ain't shit, on this side
Top five is what they had 'em all before
But his best shit is in the past, he fallin' off Mount Rushmore
He ain't outside, this his first Summer Madness on the card
So if Dizaster (disaster) ain't floodin' the streets, what's he in that category for (four)?
You ain't shit
You think you part of the roster, eeehh, it's not your place
Calm that shit down, you going to go from ""nahmasayin'"" to ""namaste""
Free Surf
That's Jersey shit
What I'm tryin' to say
Is on SMACK, the only disaster (Dizaster) we respect is a Tsu'nami wave
Get the fuck off the stage!

[Dizaster] Alright

{A long break where no one knows where Dizaster went off to. Then Dizaster pops out with a muscle shirt and a head wrap}

[Round 2: Dizaster]
{mimicking Real Sikh} You not from SMACK blibbity blap

I look like Russell Peters in a muscle t-shirt

{mimicking Real Sikh again}
Ayo Smack, wiggity wiggity
The big bibbity, the bigger the shoulder
I'm so big, I could lift up a boulder
One swipe from the armpit, Smack get a whiff of the odor
Ayo, I'm sittin' at home and I sit in the dome and I'm fillin' my quota
You get found missin', missin' in the middle of Minnesota
Which is coincidently where I was dodging missiles and boulders next to the Indian boarder

Then his fake ass goes into one of his war stories like, ""Back home in India bro. My war stories...they turned me into a soldier
I can't describe the pain to y'all seein' my best friend in a puddle of blood, hunched over
But it wasn't a gun that took his life y'all
My mans got killed by a cobra.""
What?!
You little fuckin' tough guy you from hood gimmick is over
Cause I know where you really from
You from North New Brunswick bitch, not New Brunswick, the north north, the gentrified, the white side
I asked Suge, ""Where's that even on on the map?""
He's like, ""That's the white, white, white side.""
I was like, ""What?
He's like, ""Yeah. What's his life like?""
I was like, ""What's his life like? I'll tell you what his life's like.""
You know I know my geography, right?
He lives in a one-mile radius of a gentrified town of Edison
Now Edison is all Indians who kicked out all the melinated people
So it's just them and the white guys
So they can give each other tax free corporate hi-5's
This guy- far way from the drive-bys
They always have Wi-Fi
If they can't jog their little dogs then psst, they'll take them on bike rides
Then he wants to come up here and he wants to always brag, how he got it bad
And how his mom and dad
Are not really from Islamibad, but they really live in a Tas Mahal Palace made outta marble slab
And he's got another fuckin' cousin that he calls ""Sinbad""
Who also wears this retarded rag
And the current car he has used to be his father's cab
What?!
Don't you get it? We just a novelty act
You ain't Real Sikh (sick) you a hypochondriac
And y'all believe his war stories?
But me? I know he's a clown
Just cause both of us brown don't mean shit
I've been through a war
The closest you've ever been to havin' war in the ground
Is visiting back home in ya town
And havin' to piss and shit into a hole in the ground cause you ain't got no toilets around
And we used to be just like them
...Except we can afford them right now
All this dude do is come on stage, act like me and throw shit around
But when you at the dinner table with your parents that ain't how your voice really sounds
Imagine, ""Mother, mother, I'm a hungry terrorist
Flippin' the cornbread over the asparagus
Grabbin' the lambchops, you know I ain't sharin' it
Cause if you've ever seen Sikh's resume...you know he doesn't usually cherry pick
Besides the fact that I look like a fuckin' Bollywood actor
Me and you don't got any common factors
I'm not like any of you spoiled form battlers
And I'ma tell you why all of this matters
When you go home to your parents they address you as ""Kumar"", not as the rapper
Bitch, my family respect this craft so much even my own mom calls
Me ""Dizaster""!
Whooo!
That's that Ricky Flair
Any moment now he's going to start pounding on his chest like a grizzly bear like he ain't about to get killed in here
Bro, the only thing you ever contributed to this culture is the extensions from your women's hair and it ends right there
Ain't nobody wanna hear a religious prayer from this fuckin' Cricket player
He screams ""Jersey"" like he's the city mayor
But he ain't really chillin' there
He act like he from the hood but he ain't really there
You ain't from the slum, dawg (Slumdog), you a Millionaire

{Diz takes off the muscle shirt}

You see this? I used to try to get big like him before the battles
But after I tore my ACL...for me that's it
Plus I realized at the time this sport is about sharpening the mind so, all that extra muscle today I'ma show you why we don't need that shit
Sikh, the routine you train and put in with the pen is not the same as when you put them into the plates in the gym
You can't focus on both, so now-a-days I stay gettin' thin
To let you know the condition my brain really in
Dawg, if we stay lean
It's from takin' plates and gainin' weight
Them green proteins shakes don't mean a thing
That's why slowly you've been losin' all your detailed schemes
Cause while you over there gettin' swole, over here you kept deflating
You spent too much time takin', Creatine instead of creating
You over there crawling under barbed wires
Lifting these heavy squats, benching these large tires
And somehow when you came back you just couldn't set the bar higher
Speakin' of setting the bar higher...we're on the bottom of the flyer
Thanks a lot Sanjaya
Fuckin'- Eye Of The Tiger
Hell nah it ain't time
Back home, I gotta tell you a secret about the guy
Back home, he has another wife
He left her back home in India
Cause she's handicapped and she has a deformed tibia
Handicapped, that like- you were blessed man, that's an actual freak
She's still the man of the house
So she's out in the rice fields tryin' to provide for her family to eat
Comes home after a long hard day at work and you're nowhere to be found to remove the calluses from her feet
She relaxes on the couch and unstraps the platform off her head with a latch underneath
Attached to a plastic strap that goes after her teeth
That she uses as support for her forehead so she can balance a basket of wheat
These guys think that they're experts at meditating
Just cause they can go in a yoga position on a mattress for weeks
They don't do that shit cause of willpower
They did that cause they don't have shit to eat
Bat piss on the seats
9 to 5 is cleaning up giraffe shit in the streets
His mother fuckin' licks on athlete's feet

{Aktive pulls Diz and Diz jumps back to the front of the stage}
I'll fuckin' keep goin'! Did I get that round or not?!

[Round 3: Real Sikh]
Ummm, we gotta talk about one of them famous bars that you had
You said, ""get ate (eight) sideways like the number infinity"", I started to laugh
Infinity ain't a number...he wasn't the smartest in class
But I don't blame him for gettin' numbers wrong, we know he got a problem with Math

You ain't fight him yet so it's still an angle

Teach a man how to squabble, look like I got somethin' to teach
First thing you do, stagger your stance, get in touch with ya reach
See the power that go to the hip, come from the feet
Chin tucked in the tee when you duckin' and weave
Yo teach your man how to squabble, don't be rushin' technique
Knuckles easy to break, so when you throw one you should squeeze
Do you know why boxers go tst tst tst? Because you should breathe
Hit him in the temple or the jaw, you'll at least buckle his knees
Yo teach your man how to squabble
Not jump when it's beef
He knew his homies had his back so when he swung it was weak
He planted that shit with Math, the same way he rushes his schemes
So focused on the set up that the punch wasn't clean
The fuck do you mean?
You couldn't have handled it in a parking lot?
Thought the venue would call the cops? Do it off the block
It's been 10 years, you don't wanna make the talking stop?
Math been waitin' so long for you to line up the fade he do his show in a barber shop
You always involved in drama, your life is embarrassin'
You only here cause URL petty and the hype that you carryin'
I don't like it I bury him
Knifin' a terrorist
Slicin' through his skin look like I'm writin' in Arabic
Y'all know what's hilarious?
He was just sayin', ""Fuck URL"" See how fast they switch?
For years he said the URL App ain't shit
Now no other league's fuckin' wit' you, you on the SMACK stage Diz'?
And guess where this battle goin'?
Yeah, App Gang bitch
Ayo Houston! Let me talk to y'all real quick
He said, since he battled Canibus and Cassidy he helped the culture win
But how? He got these random investors to throw events
They don't even watch battle rap, they just tossin' money and hope it stick
Give a big bag to the outsider that do a bad show then dip
While real rappers get the crumbs that they can't even hold for rent
So how you not a vulture? You the one lettin' the vultures in
You don't help the scene you poison it
Look at the fights you causin'
Same corny shit that gets you conservative, white endorsements
Type to always be writin' bars that sound racist, might be awkward
So I don't need him to pass the torch, if that the torch he light a cross with
Legend who?
You 37 and act like a kid in detention do
The attention you think you get from views make you not accept the truth
This the kind of talk to learn a lesson through
If it's easy (Eazy) to get out of character, then that character ain't meant for you
This my 18th URL battle and with all the legends I see
I'll be standin' in front of Roc and Nitty before I get to 19
I'm stamped, to get in you needed a special ID
So you can imitate my voice, but you never gon' leave an impression like me
Just be hyped that Beas' got you Summer Madness and offered a chance
After this, don't get online and talk to ya fans
Cryin', that there's a setup and it's part of the plans
Stay off of the 'Gram, and take this fuckin' loss like a man
I'm on that Jersey shit, that goin' all out shit
Real Sikh, and I'm the problem that you want rounds wit'?
You supposed to put in work, but that's wrong now bitch
Cause you can't show up to work
(When you call out Sikh (sick)!)
Jersey!

[Round 3: Dizaster]
This is it. Just let me get this off. Let me start with some rebuttals. You ready??!!!

Bitch you called me ""an embarrassment""
You gonna embarrass who?
I barely even prepared for you
You Real Sikh (sick)? Aww, I'll take care of you with some Theraflu
First of all, you wanna know how I battle? Like Goku
I will smoke you like a burnt up horse shoe
Then I'll force you
To eat pork through
A small tube
Or a snorkel
Just so it can sound like {snorts} when you pull through
You got this dude tryin' to fuck with me? He gettin' old too
This ain't the straw that broke the camel's back
This the straw I'm 'bout to snort all my Columbian coke through
Arabs, y'all real men? Y'all let your women control you
The other day my bitch asked me if we can go to Nobu and I said, ""Nooo boo!""
Real Arab
Closed the door told her to get back in the house

{Crowd starts booing}

Real Arab
Told her to get back in the fuckin' house
""But I wanna go over the-""
""Shut ya fuckin' mouth""
And you shut your mouth too you already know what I'm on
You actin' like you ain't gettin' fucked up here, barely a float holdin' on
They helpin' you
But you know how I know you ain't one of us?
{sniffs}
You got deodorant on, and that's where I draw the line
I'ma put the bitch in the red
Roll up like a mental patient with invisible friends, I hit Sikh (sick) in the head
Get his head twisted like Trippie Redd
I can say ""no"" to drugs now, I can sizzle his egg
Or I can wait for him to fall asleep
Creep in and catch him slippin' instead
A cancer patient
{gun cocks} I'll catch sick (Sikh) in the bed
Stretchin' ya
The Turbinator versus The Predator
Projectiles from the Heckler
Sound like two jets interceptin' ya
Too fast for Apu from The Simpsons to register
You used to be a high school wrestler
And you from a suburb in Jersey, you a bitch ass mark
You said I'm appropriating, but you the one appropriating this culture tryin' to impact this art
You a fake ass wrestler on the streets tryin' to front on them like you got Hitman heart (Hart)
Bitch you know you in denial, you an orphanage child
You go to war with me how?
I'll put you on FaceTime and make you watch me as I torture your cow
Look...I saved the end of this verse, cause I wanted to talk to you guys

{Diz sits down on the stage}

So I'ma get this shit off my chest
He talked a lot of shit...about us being two different type of ""Middle Easterns""
Well y'all wanna know what's the difference between us?
Today you guys are about to find out
Sikh, when was the first time you ever wrote a rhyme down?
Do you remember?
I feel like you was listening to a song or see it on TV and thought ""Maybe this is something I should try out.""
For me, do y'all wanna know when was the first time I ever wrote a rhyme down?
(When?)
I was runnin' from my school to my house to hide in my bedroom under Israeli missile strikes tryin' to hide out
All alone in my room, the pressure of me finally dyin' died out
And I used my pen to feel like I could finally survive now
And that's when I wrote my first rhyme down
In '99

I'm gonna tell y'all my life story. So y'all can boo or whatever but at least you'll hear it

And that's when I wrote my first rhyme down
In '99 we would leave Beirut, and we would take a flight out
I came to the states
My first interaction was with a white guy who told me I'm a guest in this culture and how this isn't my house
I immediately started becoming friends with all the black folks
A couple months down the line, my best homie Steve got murdered, he taught me everything about the streets
When my mom seen him on the front steps, that's when they moved me right out
You know where? To an all-white school
They thought I was gonna be cool
But it was full of white supremacists and peckerwoods
Now, can you imagine my life now?
From my homies gettin' killed to movin' me to an all-white school
Full of peckerwoods and white supremacists, imagine my life now
This was at the height of the 9/11 shit, everybody was givin' me the side mouth
I changed my name from ""Bachir"" to ""Bobby""
On the outside I was actin' tough, but on the inside I wanted to cry my eyes out
Cause I didn't wanna look like a cancer patient, but at this point it was the only way for me to hide these eyebrows

{Crowd continues to be restless}

They ain't gonna let me get it off. They don't give a fuck. Yeah, yeah. I'ma get it off. I'ma do it. They don't even wanna let me tell this goddamn shit. I'ma continue it, I ain't stoppin'. I ain't stoppin'. I ain't come all the way out here to stop. On the outside- at least be quiet so I can spit it. You guys paid for this shit

On the outside it looked like I wasn't bothered but on the inside I wanted to cry my eyes out
Cause at this point I didn't wanna look like a cancer patient, but it was the only way for me to hide these eyebrows
Now for these next- I'ma have to give you guys a disclaimer before I get these next lines out
I'ma say some shit that's gonna really get me booed
But you wanted the truth and you want the truth so right now you 'bout to find out
I walked up, yep, a group of peckerwoods told me ""dune coon""
I said, ""What?"" I didn't even know what it meant
Things started goin' around in my mind now
I didn't know what he was talkin' 'bout but I could feel the vibes now
Then he told me, ""You a sand nigga.""

{Crowd starts to boo}
Yeah I said it! Yeah I said it! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah. Nah, nah. Now listen. I'ma get this off. Yeah, yeah. No, I'm gettin' it off. I don't give a FUCK. Yeah, I'ma get it off. That's cool. Let me get my shit off

{Crowd starts chanting 3-0 for Real Sikh}

That's cool. Let me get my shit off. That's cool. I don't give a fuck that's what I was told. It's crazy- my bad. Oh, I didn't mean...

[Smack] Hold it down. Let's get it
{Rum Nitty says something to Diz and Diz responds}
Nah. I'm finishing my shit. I'm finishing. I ain't endin' it like that. Hell no
{Diz goes back to the crowd}
Aye, if y'all real hip hop y'all ain't gonna let me get my voice off? Y'all won't let me get my voice off?
[Smack] Aight, what we doin'?
[Diz] For real? Damn, that's fuckin' crazy. At least I said it

No matter how we remain in denial, yeah
Wasting time, replacing time with each empty excuse
But that'll only work a little while
Coping with despair, knowing you're not there
Ashamed to just admit I've been a fool
So I blame it on the sun, run away from everyone
Hoping to escape this ridicule
Trapped in misery, wrapped so miserably
And this deception, I wear it like a skin
Dying to maintain, oh I keep trying to explain
A heart that never loved me to begin
Oh I'm such a mess, I have no choice but to confess
That I've been desperately trying to belong
Lieing to myself and everybody else
Refusing to admit my right was wrong

Oh what's left of me, I beg you desperately
Cause me to agree with what I know is best for me
Please save me from myself, I need you, save me from myself
Please save me from myself so I can heal
The choices that I've made, oh have been nothing but mistakes
What a wasted use of space, should I die before I wake

Let's get back to where we used to be/ DC's here so get used to me/ if I'mma do it, I'mma do it unusually/ all I need is good vibe and cue up the beat/ if I was the king I'd reign for a golden generation/ and race wouldn't matter, neither would ya station/ the only thing that would count is never get complacent/ and everybody needs get met that are basic/ life's wasted if you don't get up off your ass/that's Y my mission's to shatter this ceiling of glass/ they call my culture bad say most of us crass/ well look at me boy I'm the symbol for class/ flow like a whip on the freeway, cruise control on/ top down sunlight giving a bath/ all I want if I ruled is to plant some seeds/ to see the scene Martin King saw in his dreams

Chorus: If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons (Mind, body, and soul free to travel the globe lets go)
Black diamonds and pearls (Could it be if the world could be mine we'd all shine?)
If I ruled the world (Still living for today in these last days of time)

Social issues eradicated/ we all work in harmony problems never aggrevated/ we find a way to honor the/ hard working folks that help keep up this nation/ the teachers, the firemen, and kids that they raising/ its time to raise our minds to the constellations/ and out of the basement/ that's Y I spit it stellar for the lives that are wasting/ in hopes that they hear it and feel compelled/ to blaze the trail, succeed and live to tell the tale/ hard to fail if you understand the code/ everything that's shining ain't diamonds and gold/ the wealth that you mining better be for your soul/ we write the chapters in our own history/ so live the legacy that you want to be told over centuries/ compete against ya self no more having enemies/ keep ya circle close get rid of negative energy/ remember all good things come in trinities/ we all one entity, and if I ruled the world when I left they'd B missing me

Marin Luther King: ""And when this happens, when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, ""Free at last! free at last! thank God Almighty, we are free at last!""You might also like1Embed"

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Ayo, Black—it's time, word (Word, it's time, man)
Yeah, it's time, man (Aight, man, begin)
Yeah—straight out the fuckin' dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas don't make it back
I don't know how to start this shit, yo—now;
[Verse 1]
Rappers; I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm, I be kickin'
Musician, inflictin' composition of pain
I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine
Holdin' an M16, see, with the pen I'm extreme
Now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up with street clothes, hand me a .9 and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sittin' bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner bettin' Grants with the cee-lo champs
Laughin' at base-heads, tryna sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
Niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
Once they caught us off-guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass, and
I ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
Picked the MAC up, told brothers ""Back up!"" — the MAC spit
Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, I made him back-flip
Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze, heard it click, ""Yo, my shit is stuck!""
Tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So, now I'm jettin' to the buildin' lobby
And it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as I be
(So, what you sayin'?) It's like the game ain't the same
Got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name
And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us
.45’s and gauges, MAC's in fact
Same niggas will catch you back-to-back, snatchin' your cracks
In black, there was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked
So hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
I know this crackhead who said she gotta smoke nice rock
And if it's good, she'll bring you customers and measuring pots
But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation
Inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
It drops deep as it does in my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
I think of crime when I'm in a New York State of Mind

[Verse 2]
Be havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta, drinkin' Moëts, holdin' TEC's
Makin' sure the cash came correct, then I stepped
Investments in stock, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks
Winnin' gunfights with mega-cops
But just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
Give me a Smith & Wesson, I'll have niggas undressin'
Thinkin' of cash flow, Buddha and shelter
Whenever frustrated, I'ma hijack Delta
In the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
Full of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back
Black, I'm livin' where the nights is jet-black
The fiends fight to get crack, I just max, I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane
Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain
And be prosperous, though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, blamin' us; we're held like hostages
It's only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes
I'm takin' rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow
My rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
I'm a addict for sneakers, 20's of Buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzled as I backtrack to earlier times
Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind

Visit beautiful places, there's more out here than the trap
Houses in Long Island, they always found 'em
House in the South, a nigga barely got out
Sunny L.A., remеmber calls with Dr. Dre
He told mе, ""Don't let the palm trees fool you, nigga, be safe""

Somehow we lost the connection, might meet at Joshua Tree
And it's been bothering me, too many wavy women

That's where baguettes are from, French bread that's long and narrow

Broke the meanin' down of the Virgin Mary
And you got your own place, my favorite part of the night
When you text me that you made it home safe (I'm home)
I'm contemplatin' at the home base
How I'm used to breakfast in the ghetto, sippin' OJ
That's a picture right there, a moment in time
Before anybody wanted a photo of mine
Before the internet energy and social decline
Destroyed the vibe, foolin' us with the headlines

All my time has been focused on my freedom now
Why would I join 'em when I know that I can beat 'em now?
They put their words on me, and they can eat 'em now
That's probably why they keep on tellin' me I'm needed now
They tried to box me out while takin' what they want from me
I spent too many years livin' too uncomfortably
Making room for people who didn't like the labor
But wanted the spoils, greedy, selfish behavior
Now let me give it to you balanced and with clarity
I don't need to turn myself into a parody
I don't, I don't do the shit you do for popularity
They clearly didn't understand when I said ""I Get Out"" apparently
My awareness like Keanu in The Matrix
I'm savin' souls and y'all complainin' 'bout my lateness
Now it's illegal for someone to walk in greatness
They want the same shh, but they don't take risks
Now the world will get to see its own reflection
And the anointed can pursue their own direction
And if you're wrong and you're too proud to hear correction
Walk into the hole you dug yourself, fuck a projection
See me in my freedom takin' all my land back
They said a lot against me thinkin' I'd just stand back
I got my legs beneath me, I got my hands back
A lot of people sabotaged, they couldn't stand that
I turned the other cheek, I took blow after blow
There's so much crisis in the world 'cause you reap what you sow
When you keep what you know is meant for someone else
The ditch you dig for them, you might just end up in yourself
I'm in the secret place, I keep a sacred space
They keep showin' their hands, but keep hidin' their face
If I'm a messenger, you block me then you block the message
So aggressive, the world you made is what you're left with
Pride and ego over love and truth is fuckin' reckless
Y'all niggas got a death wish, the stupid leaves me breathless
[Outro: Nas]
Some place to be, yeah
Ain't duckin' nothin'

Life is like a jungle, black, it's like the habitat of Tarzan
Matter of fact, it's harder than most can imagine
Most of my niggas packed in correctional facilities
Half of them passed on, MAC strong, couple of shots
Made the ghost leave a body, now they hauntin' the block
Where they used to stand at, somebody's takin' they place
A younger man perhaps, hand slaps, can't understand that
Same walk, same talk, I wonder can that be possible?

To pull guns quick and always look behind the shoulder
Think of how many dudes died tryna be down with you
Everybody's under six feet of ground, but you
Still standin', still roamin' through the streets, that's real
You a survivor, knowin' all the beef is ill
You got a bunch of thugs with you even now that's ready
Trustin' your judgment, quick to put it down, they deadly
The hood love you, but behind your back, they pray for the day
A bullet hit your heart and ambulances take you away
That ain't love, it's hate, think of all the mothers at wakes
Whose sons you killed and you ain't got a cut on your face?
Unmarked police cars roam the streets hard, the heat is God
Somebody tell these shorties reach for the stars
Instead they tell 'em how to reach through the bars holdin' a mirror

Reactin' before thinkin', they easily irritated
And murder's premeditated, it's a fact that we sinkin'
When we should be climbin', in a nutshell, it's just jail
Drug sales, liquor and diamonds, niggas rewindin'
Instead of movin' forward to blow up, so what's the science?
People shoutin', police pushin' the crowd
And on the ground's a young soldier with meat hangin' out him
Am I hallucinatin' off the hazin'?
Or did I just see a nigga shoot another nigga's face in?
It's a ugly nation, cops circle the block with mug shots
Photograph pictures of suspect faces
It's usually two or three niggas who innocent
But if they lock the wrong ones up, then someone'll snitch
A divide-and-fall strategy, they aren't fair
I dig in my bag of weed that's covered with orange hair

And Celie, Oprah and Danny Glover gots to feel me

While all the old folks pray to Jesús, soakin' they sins in trays
Of holy water, odds against Nas is slaughter
Thinkin' a word best describin' my life to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection
Born in correction, all the wrong shit I did, he'll lead in right direction
How you livin'? Large or broke on charge cards and mediocre?
You flippin' coke or playin' spit, spades, and strip poker?
[Chorus: Pete Rock + Nas]

It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours

[Verse 3: Nas]
I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home
I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
‘Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Tryin' to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana, stabbin' women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin' Big Willie style
Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash loot in fly clothes, burnin' dollars to light my stoge
Walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames, plus the games people play
Bust the problems of the world today
[Chorus: Pete Rock + Nas]
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?

Wake up out the bed scruffy, sparkin' my J

My old lady call me baby, told her, ""Pardon my age""
Twelve shells in the gauge like a carton of eggs
We goin' home like Eric Cartman, chromosomes on my conscience
Hear some niggas talkin' nonsense, call up Nasty Nastradamus
Rock the pearls and diamonds, break the promise, break her wallets
Break her heart and break her pockets, takin' notes like guidance counselors
Aristocrat like the chancellor, the answer to the, uh, panhandlers
The corners with the mans is up, the jig is up, the scams is up
Yeah, they hands is up, lookin' in the crowd, yeah
Tryna fuck the world, but my pants still up
Tryna invest, to all my G's, before we rest in peace
'Cause we sure to rest in peace
The rest is set, the record set as soon as I release
The rumors be, I roam the streets with no security
They know a nigga overseas (Uh)

It tore the community at a high rate, adversity I faced
I roll my own gas to make sure that it's not laced
Damn, I used to hit the block hopin' they see me
Watchin' Video Music Box, sittin' close to the TV
I was inspired by Whodini and Kool G
Got my first pair of J's, thought I was 2-3 (Air)
Invest in all my G's before we rest in peace

Noah Kahan,Stick Season,"56 ContributorsTranslationsالعربيةEspañolDeutschFrançaisNorsk (bokmål / riksmål)Stick Season Lyrics[Verse 1]
As you promised me that I was more than all the miles combined
You must've had yourself a change of heart like halfway through the drive
Because your voice trailed off exactly as you passed my exit sign
Kept on drivin' straight and left our future to the right
Now I am stuck between my anger and the blame that I can't face
And memories are somethin' even smoking weed does not replace
And I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains
Doc told me to travel, but there's Covid on the planes

[Chorus]
And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do

[Verse 2]
So I thought that if I piled something good on all my bad
That I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from Dad
No, I am no longer funny 'cause I miss the way you laugh
You once called me ""forever,"" now you still can't call me back

Nujabes,Feather,"89 ContributorsFeather Lyrics[Verse 1: Cise Starr]
Light as a feather when I'm floating through
Reading through the daily news
Measuring the hurt within the golden rule
Centimetres of ether, I'm heating the speaker
Motivational teacher with words that burn people
Seeing the headlines lined with discord
It's either genocide or the planet in uproar
Never good.  The rules of paradise are never nice
The best laid plans of Mice and Men are never right
I'm just a Vagabond with Flowers for Algernon
An Average Joe who knows what the fuck is going on
It's the hope of my thoughts that I travel upon
Fly like an arrow of God until I'm gone, so I'm

[Chorus: Cise Starr]
Drifting away like a feather in air
Letting my words take me away from the hurt and despair
So I'm keeping it vertical forever elevator
Riding the escalator to reach something that is greater, so I'm
Drifting away like a feather in air
Letting my soul take me away from the hurt and despair
So I'm keeping it vertical forever elevator
Riding the escalator to reach something that is greater

[Verse 2: Akin Yai]
Taking chances, word tap dancing with wolves
In an ice arena out there, deep in the woods of
Arizona, the sun be high, life's ironic, ain't it?
Trying to be Dalí when I write
Surreal Life, I paint it
Vivid, habitat crazy insane
Watchin' propaganda six o'clock news and it’s saying
Cultures clash, poor black folk and white trash
They revel in the cyberspace that might crash, dash
To millennium a million miles of running
At the speed of now back, don't return gunning
Rambo style, gung-ho child gunning
Ammo blao two times, loud stunning
Stunning, when I hit ya, lift you off the Earth like
Ayo, take you right back to birth and
Niggas wonder why, they might wonder why
This shit might happen but it does, they go

So I'm keeping it vertical forever elevator

[Verse 3: Cise Starr]
Treat you better than me 'cause that's the heavenly key
To unlock the inner strength where my essence will be
It's the knowledge and self-understanding of the things around me
That becomes the wisdom that I need
Living this life to the best of my ability
Channeling energy to my thoughts, attain symmetry
Remember me, because my prose remain gold
I got the gift of gab like them pimps in Kangol
It never ends, I keep it rolling like a cypher
The first caveman bringing fire
Innovating and higher; to plasma states I raise the stakes
It's double or nothing in this vacuum space
I will, survive, divine the time to cry
Fuck a hold or hide, I'm alive with pride
And I drove the Chevy to the Levy
But the Levy was dry, singing ""This will be the day that I die""71Embed"
Nujabes,Lady Brown,"40 ContributorsLady Brown Lyrics[Verse 1: Cise Starr]
Crush a coal to a diamond, eyes forever shining
Your beauty alone inspire a nigga to rhyming
Thinking of the better things in life
Thinking of how I could persuade you to become my wife
Hand in hand as we floating over tropical sands
You my lady, I'm your man, so let's further advance
To the next scene, me sleeping next to you, resting (Haha)
You're the personification of all God's blessings
Coming to me in just one physical being (Yeah)
One physical dream that I wanna redeem
You're voluptuous, sweet, caramel-brown, honeydew
Satin skin smooth to the touch, what a nigga do?
So sensual, her smile like a chemical
Extract of perfection, rare mineral
She smell like a happy birthday on a Thursday
Quiet time love, sleep in, I'll wake early

[Chorus: Cise Starr]
Honey brown with the long, black hair
Teasing me with a kiss and a stare
Slight touch and you're taking me there
So fine and it just ain't fair
So beautiful and so damn rare

[Verse 2: Cise Starr]
She's angelic and energetic, using sex as a weapon
I reckon that I'm confessing her body is just a blessing
From God down to Earth, she needs to be in a church
To prove we didn't spawn from fish, but God's work
Hurts to see her clothed 'cause her body beholds
Secrets untold, valued like platinum and gold
For she is the key to open my mind to see
The energy that radiates from the gates of heavenly
Bliss, I reminisce over touch and a kiss
While you fucking a bitch, I go to make love to my miss
Never scandalous, it's unanimous that the hue will handle it
Lights off and candle-lit rooms are glamorous
Yo, I'll call you love, sexual, you look edible
Parallel, snuggle up close, intellectual
In a rendezvous, push you a rap hairdo
No makeup, in jean shorts, open-toed shoe
I want to hold you, mold your soul, I'll behold you
Know you better than myself, never own you
But keep you, never leave you, I'll beseech you
God's gift to man is you wearing a see-through
Riding Sea-Doos in Atlantic Ocean, causing commotion
Lay you down, going through the motions
Keep your skin soft, lotions got me coasting
Down, pretty, round, brown, thighs, the candles low-lit

Look at this agreeable, delightful, delectable
Unforgettable, so sweet she may be edible
She needs a pedestal to step out of heaven—you ready, boo?
Never hypothetical, you factual and magical
Fuck theatrical, baby girl, because you actual
Physically, your chemistry is so mathematical
Had to use academics to define your spirit
You lifting my limits, your name off of my tongue is a lyric
She's a compilation of my mind's representation
Of a representative representing an excellent revelation
Of time and dedication (She will), never impatient (For real)
She know the deal, (Reveal) herself to me
So I can see her heavenly ways, her heavenly gaze
And, plus, it don't hurt that she has an ass for days (Okay)
So as we lay, I reminisce on the day that we met
Please, God, never let me forget...18Embed"
Nujabes,Luv,"57 ContributorsLuv(sic) Lyrics[Intro: Bill Cosby & Shing02]
I told you that story to tell you this one
Check this out, this goes out to my G
[Verse 1: Shing02]
Lovesick like a dog with canine sensitivity
Developing this new theory of relativity
Connecting our souls resting in captivity
Positive life sacrifice what it is to me
Our history, only a quarter of a century
Reality, sitting on the shoulders of our chemistry
See, ain't no mystery
The colors that we mix will set the mind free
Let the blind see beyond harmony
Breathe life into dead space blow away your clouds of doubt
New territory we determine to be
Everything a safe haven it's supposed to be
Now it might seem distant but the time is near
When our thoughts take off and split the atmosphere
Pure sound wave travel semi-infinitely
Plus I'll see you there utmost definitely

[Chorus: Shing02 & Richard Pryor]
'Cause the beat plus the melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E. eloquently, so evidently
(I mean that from my heart 'cause you make me feel good as a person)
'Cause the beat plus the melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E. eloquently, so evidently
You might also like[Verse 2: Shing02]
Good gracious, every process has a genesis and ends with a revelation
God bless this opportunity for me to find a voice
For some words that have waited for way too long
Low wages, small tips on the avenue
Never wasted, all hits for a revenue
Haven't you heard the news lately?
Seems we've been living for some time in a purgatory
But yo, I thought I knew what a love song sound like
But I felt a warmer tune in the sunlight
I could still hear it in my room past midnight
Gotta move, take a solo cruise in the moon light
Sometimes I do forget, oh how much we could ease the lives we lead
If we learn to let go, the reins that we hold
Return to our souls, and the spirit let flow
So you see, upon everyday faced there's a million shades to
Express definition of grace
But the method I choose my prerogative
There's so much love in me I got to give

[Chorus: Shing02, Richard Pryor & Jeru the Damaja]
'Cause the beat plus the melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E. eloquently, so evidently
(I mean that from my heart  'cause you make me feel good as a person)
'Cause the beat plus the melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E. eloquently, so evidently
(I hope that you listen)
[Verse 3: Shing02]
Oh, how I could write a book on how you make me feel
But how about this song that I wrote for you?
What I feel like, I wanna put my trusts in these simple words
For you to feel what I'm saying, what you feel like?
Reminisce about the little episodes that we shared together
Remember the time that you told me
In the cold night, to relax when all I knew was to hold tight
Remember the time that I spoke to the crowd in a full house and
Realized that you was my ace?
I was the joker on the stage singing the blues
All eyes on me and had nothing to prove
But yo, I thought I knew what a diamond shine like
But I felt a sharper love in the limelight
From the queen of hearts watching me quietly from the upper deck balcony
Sometimes I do suspect
I'm an actor in a well-scripted live divine comedy
When I look back, that frozen slice of time
And try to defrost the senses lost
Now enough with the metaphors
The motivation that I wrote this letter for
For you to know that the music helps carry on
Like you say, a new day will bring us tomorrow

[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus: Shing02 & Richard Pryor]
Yo, 'cause my beat plus your melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E. eloquently so evidently
'Cause your beat plus my melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E. eloquently so evidently
'Cause my beat plus your melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E. eloquently so evidently
(I mean that—I mean that from my heart 'cause you make me feel good as a person you know)
'Cause your beat plus my melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E. eloquently so evidently
(I mean that—I mean—I mean that from my heart 'cause you make me feel good as a person)

Oscar Peterson,Blue And Sentimental,"1 ContributorSong of the Lark (Chap. 2.2) LyricsSO Thea did not go to a boarding-house after all. When Dr. Archie left Chicago she was comfortably settled with Mrs. Lorch, and her happy reunion with her trunk somewhat consoled her for his departure.

Mrs. Lorch and her daughter lived half a mile from the Swedish Reform Church, in an old square frame house, with a porch supported by frail pillars, set in a damp yard full of big lilac bushes. The house, which had been left over from country times, needed paint badly, and looked gloomy and despondent among its smart Queen Anne neighbors. There was a big back yard with two rows of apple trees and a grape arbor, and a warped walk, two planks wide, which led to the coal bins at the back of the lot. Thea's room was on the second floor, overlooking this back yard, and she understood that in the winter she must carry up her own coal and kindling from the bin. There was no furnace in the house, no running water except in the kitchen, and that was why the room rent was small. All the rooms were heated by stoves, and the lodgers pumped the water they needed from the cistern under the porch, or from the well at the entrance of the grape arbor. Old Mrs. Lorch could never bring herself to have costly improvements made in her house; indeed she had very little money. She preferred to keep the house just as her husband built it, and she thought her way of living good enough for plain people.

Thea's room was large enough to admit a rented upright piano without crowding. It was, the widowed daughter said, ""a double room that had always before been occupied by two gentlemen""; the piano now took the place of a second occupant. There was an ingrain carpet on the floor, green ivy leaves on a red ground, and clumsy, old-fashioned walnut furniture. The bed was very wide, and the mattress thin and hard. Over the fat pillows were ""shams"" embroidered in Turkey red, each with a flowering scroll—one with ""Gute' Nacht,"" the other with ""Guten Morgen."" The dresser was so big that Thea wondered how it had ever been got into the house and up the narrow stairs. Besides an old horsehair armchair, there were two low plush ""spring-rockers,"" against the massive pedestals of which one was always stumbling in the dark. Thea sat in the dark a good deal those first weeks, and sometimes a painful bump against one of those brutally immovable pedestals roused her temper and pulled her out of a heavy hour. The wall-paper was brownish yellow, with blue flowers. When it was put on, the carpet, certainly, had not been consulted. There was only one picture on the wall when Thea moved in: a large colored print of a brightly lighted church in a snow-storm, on Christmas Eve, with greens hanging about the stone doorway and arched windows. There was something warm and home, like about this picture, and Thea grew fond of it. One day, on her way into town to take her lesson, she stopped at a bookstore and bought a photograph of the Naples bust of Julius Caesar. This she had framed, and hung it on the big bare wall behind her stove. It was a curious choice, but she was at the age when people do inexplicable things. She had been interested in Caesar's ""Commentaries"" when she left school to begin teaching, and she loved to read about great generals; but these facts would scarcely explain her wanting that grim bald head to share her daily existence. It seemed a strange freak, when she bought so few things, and when she had, as Mrs. Andersen said to Mrs. Lorch, ""no pictures of the composers at all.""

Both the widows were kind to her, but Thea liked the mother better. Old Mrs. Lorch was fat and jolly, with a red face, always shining as if she had just come from the stove, bright little eyes, and hair of several colors. Her own hair was one cast of iron-gray, her switch another, and her false front still another. Her clothes always smelled of savory cooking, except when she was dressed for church or KAFFEEKLATSCH, and then she smelled of bay rum or of the lemon-verbena sprig which she tucked inside her puffy black kid glove. Her cooking justified all that Mr. Larsen had said of it, and Thea had never been so well nourished before.

The daughter, Mrs. Andersen,—Irene, her mother called her,—was a different sort of woman altogether. She was perhaps forty years old, angular, big-boned, with large, thin features, light-blue eyes, and dry, yellow hair, the bang tightly frizzed. She was pale, anaemic, and sentimental. She had married the youngest son of a rich, arrogant Swedish family who were lumber merchants in St. Paul. There she dwelt during her married life. Oscar Andersen was a strong, full-blooded fellow who had counted on a long life and had been rather careless about his business affairs. He was killed by the explosion of a steam boiler in the mills, and his brothers managed to prove that he had very little stock in the big business. They had strongly disapproved of his marriage and they agreed among themselves that they were entirely justified in defrauding his widow, who, they said, ""would only marry again and give some fellow a good thing of it."" Mrs. Andersen would not go to law with the family that had always snubbed and wounded her—she felt the humiliation of being thrust out more than she felt her impoverishment; so she went back to Chicago to live with her widowed mother on an income of five hundred a year. This experience had given her sentimental nature an incurable hurt.

Something withered away in her. Her head had a downward droop; her step was soft and apologetic, even in her mother's house, and her smile had the sickly, uncertain flicker that so often comes from a secret humiliation. She was affable and yet shrinking, like one who has come down in the world, who has known better clothes, better carpets, better people, brighter hopes. Her husband was buried in the Andersen lot in St. Paul, with a locked iron fence around it. She had to go to his eldest brother for the key when she went to say good-bye to his grave. She clung to the Swedish Church because it had been her husband's church.

As her mother had no room for her household belongings, Mrs. Andersen had brought home with her only her bedroom set, which now furnished her own room at Mrs. Lorch's. There she spent most of her time, doing fancywork or writing letters to sympathizing German friends in St. Paul, surrounded by keepsakes and photographs of the burly Oscar Andersen. Thea, when she was admitted to this room, and shown these photographs, found herself wondering, like the Andersen family, why such a lusty, gay-looking fellow ever thought he wanted this pallid, long-cheeked woman, whose manner was always that of withdrawing, and who must have been rather thin-blooded even as a girl.

Mrs. Andersen was certainly a depressing person. It sometimes annoyed Thea very much to hear her insinuating knock on the door, her flurried explanation of why she had come, as she backed toward the stairs. Mrs. Andersen admired Thea greatly. She thought it a distinction to be even a ""temporary soprano""—Thea called herself so quite seriously—in the Swedish Church. She also thought it distinguished to be a pupil of Harsanyi's. She considered Thea very handsome, very Swedish, very talented. She fluttered about the upper floor when Thea was practicing. In short, she tried to make a heroine of her, just as Tillie Kronborg had always done, and Thea was conscious of something of the sort. When she was working and heard Mrs. Andersen tip-toeing past her door, she used to shrug her shoulders and wonder whether she was always to have a Tillie diving furtively about her in some disguise or other.

At the dressmaker's Mrs. Andersen recalled Tillie even more painfully. After her first Sunday in Mr. Larsen's choir, Thea saw that she must have a proper dress for morning service. Her Moonstone party dress might do to wear in the evening, but she must have one frock that could stand the light of day. She, of course, knew nothing about Chicago dressmakers, so she let Mrs. Andersen take her to a German woman whom she recommended warmly. The German dressmaker was excitable and dramatic. Concert dresses, she said, were her specialty. In her fitting-room there were photographs of singers in the dresses she had made them for this or that SANGERFEST. She and Mrs. Andersen together achieved a costume which would have warmed Tillie Kronborg's heart. It was clearly intended for a woman of forty, with violent tastes. There seemed to be a piece of every known fabric in it somewhere.

When it came home, and was spread out on her huge bed, Thea looked it over and told herself candidly that it was ""a horror."" However, her money was gone, and there was nothing to do but make the best of the dress. She never wore it except, as she said, ""to sing in,"" as if it were an unbecoming uniform. When Mrs. Lorch and Irene told her that she ""looked like a little bird-of-Paradise in it,"" Thea shut her teeth and repeated to herself words she had learned from Joe Giddy and Spanish Johnny.

In these two good women Thea found faithful friends, and in their house she found the quiet and peace which helped her to support the great experiences of that winter.Embed"

Check it
Well it's the M-I-crooked letter, ain't no one better
And when I'm on the microphone you best to wear your sweater
'Cause I'm cooler than a polar bear's toenails
""Oh hell, there he go again talking that shit""
Bend corners like I was a curve, I struck a nerve
And now you 'bout to see this Southern playa serve
I heard it's not where you're from but where you pay rent
Then I heard it's not what you make but how much you spent
You got me bent like elbows, amongst other things, but I'm not worried
'Cause when we step up in the party; like a mouse, you scurry
So go get your fucking shine box and your sack of nickels
It tickles to see you try to be like Mr. Pickles
Daddy Fat Sax, B-I-G B-O-I
It's that same motherfucka that took them knuckles to your eye
And I try, to warn you not to test but you don't listen
Giving the shout-out to my Uncle Darnell locked up in prison

[Chorus: Big Boi & André 3000]
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit

Or will it give a fuck about what others say and get gone?

And now I'm sitting at the end of the month I just made it
Like you made the B team, and like your daddy's wife you making that coffee
You heard the ATLiens, so back the hell up off me
[Verse 4: André 3000]
Softly as if I played piano in the dark
Found a way to channel my anger now to embark
The world's a stage and everybody gots to play their part
God works in mysterious ways, so when he starts
The job of speaking through us, we be so sincere with this here
No drugs or alcohol, so I can get the signal clear as day
Put my Glock away, I got a stronger weapon
That never runs out of ammunition, so I'm ready for war, okay

[Chorus: Big Boi & André 3000]
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, ""O-Yea-yer""

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Now is the time to get on—like Spike Lee said, ""Get on the Bus""
Go get your work and keep your beeper chirping—it's a must
Is you on that dust or corn starch? Familiar with that smack, man?
The music is like that green stuff provided to you by sack-man
Pacman, how in the fuck you think we gon' do that, man?
Riding round Old National on eighteens without no gat, man
I'm strapped, man, and ready to bust on any nigga like that, man
Me and my nigga, we roll together like Batman and Robin
We prayed together through hard times, swung hard when it was fitting
But now, we tapping the brakes from all them corners that we be bending
In Volkswagens and Bonnevilles, Chevrolets and Coupe de Villes
If you ain't got no rims, nigga, don't get no wood-grain steering wheel, for real (Real)
You can go on and chill out and still build
Let your paper stack 'stead of going into overkill
And pay your fuckin' beeper bill, bitch

Even the Sun goes down, heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie
And sometimes, ""Y""
Nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain
And nothing lasts forever, but until they close the curtain
It's him and I: Aquemini
[Verse 2: André 3000]
Twice upon a time, there was a boy who died
Lived happily ever after, but that's another chapter
Live from ""home of the brave,"" with dirty dollars
Beauty parlors, baby ballers, bowling-ball Impalas
Street scholars, majoring in culinary arts—
You know, how to work bread, cheese, and dough from scratch
But, see, the catch is you can get caught
Know what you selling, what you bought, so cut that big talk
Let's walk to the bridge—meet me halfway
Now you may see some children dead off in the pathway
It's them poor babies walking slowly to the candy lady
It's looking bad—
Need some hope like the words ""maybe,"" ""if,"" or ""probably""
More than a hobby
When my turntables get wobbly, they don't fall
I'm sorry, y'all, I often drift—I'm talking gift
So when it comes, you never look the horse inside its grill
Of course, you know I feel like the bearer of bad news
Don't want to be it, but it's needed, so what have you?
Now, question: Is every nigga with dreads for the cause?
Is every nigga with golds for the fall?
Naww, so don't get caught up in appearance
It's OutKast, ""Aquemini"": another Black experience

I stay down with these streets 'cause these streets is where my folks at
Better know that, some say we pro-Black, but we professional

Get off the testicles and the nutsacks, you bust 'round, we bust back
G—Get back for real niggas that's out here tryna spit facts
You 'ear that? You can't come near that, maybe you need to quit (Quit)
Because ""Aquemini"" is Aquarius and the Gemini running shit
Like this, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 4: André 3000]
My mind warps and bends, floats the wind, count to ten
Meet the twin, André Ben', welcome to the lion's den
Original skin, many men comprehend
I extend myself, so you go out and tell a friend
Sin all depends on what you believing in
Faith is what you make it—that's the hardest shit since MC Ren
Alien can blend right on in with your kin
Look again, 'cause I swear, I spot one every now and then
It's happening again, wish I could tell you when
""André, this is André, y'all are just gon' have to make amends""

Somebody hit me the other day for a rendezvous
Was it the bitch that fucked the Goodie and the Dungeon Crew?
Let's say her name was Suzy Skrew 'cause she screwed a lot
Makin' a nigga hit that chonk at legitimate spots
Not no parks, backseats, or things of that nature
Had to hate ya, playa
I'm dickin' the ho down — never said I paid her
Straight laid her, slayed the bitch like Darth Vader, made her
From College Park and Fayette all the way down to Decatur
Like Jada, her wig was sharp and sporty — that was shawty
Safe as a snake on eggs in a Bimmer 840
It's foggy, I went to the crib to call her but she lost me
My baby mama beeped me, seven o'clock, it's gonna cost me
But I still wanna cut her, though — maybe she had to work?
I caught her in the mall, wearin' a real tight skirt
She was fine as fuck — I wanted to sex the ho up
She said, ""Let's hit the parking lot so I can sick your duck""
I said, ""Cool, I really wanted to cut you but this'll do
I gotta pick up my daughter, plus my baby mama beeped me, too""
She said she understood and everythin' was kosher
I gave her a Lil' Wil CD and a fuckin' poster
It's like that, now

Party, but you can not call it that 'cause it was slummer
Well, it was more like spend the night
Three in the mornin', yawnin', dancin' under street lights
We chillin' like a villain, and a nigga feelin' right
In the middle of the ghetto on the curb, but in spite of all the bullshit
We on our back, starin' at the stars above (Aww, man)
Talkin' bout what we gonna be when we grow up (Mm)
I said, ""What you wanna be?"" She said, ""Alive""
It made me think for a minute, then looked in her eyes
I coulda died, time went on, I got grown
Rhyme got strong, mind got blown
I came back home to find lil' Sasha was gone
Her mama said she with a nigga that be treatin' her wrong (Man)
I kept on singin' my song and hopin' at a show
That I would one day see her standin' in the front row
But two weeks later, she got found in the back of a school
With a needle in her arm, baby two months due

Try and explain your feelings, sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, so
Shut the fuck—, I mean, please don't talk
I done been through too much and I don't need another loss
Put that on every war scar for every battle I fought

Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it

Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'

As your bad day disappears
No longer wound up like a spring
Before you've had too much
Come back in focus again

They've got a Cheshire cat grin
All blurring into one
This place is on a mission
Before the night owl
Before the animal noises
Closed circuit cameras
Before you're comatose

Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
The beat goes 'round and 'round

Words are sawn-off shotguns
Come on and let it out

Who wouldn't believe this? I heard the word on the street is
I'm still one of the deepest on the mic since Adidas
They said I changed the times from the rhymes that I thought of
So I made some more to put the New World in Order
With mathematics, put your status above the average
And help you rappers make paragraphs with graphics
'Cause new days is dawnin', new ways of performin'
Brainstormin', I write and watch the night turn to mornin'
On and on and, I got the whole world respondin'
Rock, I keep it hot, blow the spot without warnin'

Wish they was a rebel with cerebral mettle
Inflex the bezzle with the peddle to the metal
In a thug's paradise where love have a price

Some hug mics to the world, hung like parasites

So I can watch people
Because love backwards is evil

Connect set for certain, total networking
Last chance to advance and stash grands
If you have plans to have fam and mad land
Own shine, condone crime or hold 9s
I know what the problem is, killing our own kind
To my flame throwers, train sober, remain soldiers
Stay sane so these pretty dames can hold us
Terror terrain rollers and Range Rovers so the train goers
Claim your fame, maintain, till your game's over

[Chorus: Sample]
""Levantaré""

[Verse 6]
Ghetto alert, let's do whatever work to get rid of the curse
We went from 1st to America's worst
On this competitive turf, now let's inherit the earth
There's more prize for one another, and call shots
12:00 o'clock 'til the next ball drop
All year around plus they shuffle nonstop
You think it's rough at the bottom, it's even rougher on top
My peeps gonna have to reach and turn for me
And everybody's side of the street'll be sunny
Ain't nothing funny, burn plenty and burn money
And earn money and watch the century turn 20

Yeah
It's the God Rakim
Word up, I'm blazin' this out to all my comrades
Ya know I mean?
From the slums of New York, to the gutters all over the world
This is for y'all

[Verse 1]
Through my travels, I try to take righteous steps
Because right or left could mean life or death
No matter how trife it get, my sights is set
But it's twice the threat when the nights is death
My mental windows refuse to close, they get exposed
To the neighborhood info where the poison wind blows
A deadly plague spreadin' negativity, viciously
Unto every city be in ghetto misery
Don't let it get to me, the writer be left to die
But it get mesmerize if it catch your eye
Shine's enormous, from jewellery, vehicles and garments
But it's torment, jealousy, drug wars or warrents
Tallyin', slowly turnin' into barbarians
More scary when the whole boulevard's carryin'
Livin' in the world of sin, my ghetto girls and men
Waitin' for the world to end

[Verse 2]
I see destruction, even little kids trust none
They bust guns, that's what they get a rush from
When I see 'em, we build and have a real discussion
""Yo Ra, what's the jewel of the day?"" ""What up, son?""
""You got ambition?"" Shorty said, ""Man, listen
I got demands for livin', can't stand division
Make grands on my mission, 'til everythin' glisten
Women in the Expedition, no plans for prison
In a vision the city get, two milleni, G
Sittin' in my embassy, sippin' Hennesy
Gettin' high, and watch life pass me by""
So I asked him why, with a fast reply
He said, ""I'm livin' just to die without any feelings
So I wait here for my maker 'til it's time to go
With this dime I know, with all of her girls and all of my men
Waitin' for the world to end""

[Verse 3]
Shorty was taught to keep his head to the sky, and never cry
But the streets left him to die, now it's death in his eye
Livin' in sin'll give men a sinister grin
From the beginnin' to end, in it to win
Evil rebels, doin' what we do in the ghetto
Thinkin' if we was thorough we could deceive the devil
You can't win, your life'll end, try again
Shorty said, ""Why we born again to die again?""
That's what I said when I realized I had a gift
To uplift and be one of Allah's advocates
Teach the youth and speak the truth
Show 'em what peace can do when they'll reach for you
And my reward won't be jewels or cheese, it's even better
I can be one of the greatest MC's ever
If I tell 'em they intelligent women and great men
And live, stop waitin' for the world to end

Hoy es día de fútbol, fiesta y reggaetón
Llamen los vecinos, saque el televisor
El equipo está duro y quiere salir campeón
Guarden energía para que canten el gol (Gol, gol, gol)
Olé, olé, olea
La bajo de pecho y la meto de volea
Olé, olé, olea
Después del partido también se pelea
El pana está trayendo la fría
En la calle ya se escucha algarabía
Futbolero desde que era cría
Cierren la cuadra que hoy juega la selección mía

Saba,PROM / KING,"113 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçePROM / KING Lyrics[Part I: ""PROM""]

[Verse: Saba]
This remind me of before we had insomnia (Right)
Sleeping peacefully, never needed a pile of drugs
Everybody was college-bound
No dollar amounts, in God we trust
Senior year, my prom ain't had no party bus
My cousin hit me on Facebook like, ""What shorty you taking?""
I'm lying, I'm playing, I'm saying I got one to take and I'm waiting on her response
Wrote her a three-page letter, it's three days later, never hit me back—she broke my heart
So now he IM'ing me shit like, ""Yo, is shorty bad?""
I pretend not to be depressed she never wrote me back
I hit him back, like, ""Yo, well fuck her, it's on to the next""
I wrote that message thinking, ""I'm awkward, prolly never have sex""
You know in high school, sixteen, you prolly late
My cousin hit me back: ""Don't trip, bro, I got you a date""
So he sent me this link to some girl I had never seen
He said to call and tell her Walter sent you, you with me
I think about it for a minute, like, ""What's his intentions?""
I mean, we never really got along or used to kick it
In fact, if I remember—vividly—he picked on me
He used to beat me up and take my sneakers every family visit
I'm skeptical to let her know I'm Walter little cousin
What if this shit all a joke? Then again, what if it wasn't?
Would I really risk the chance of me potentially fucking on some stranger daughter
'Cause I barely know if I can trust him?
Prolly not
I finally call her, tell her, ""Walter sent me, my name Tahj""
She ask me, ""What's the color scheme that we gon' wear to prom?""
I'm acting like I'm not excited, tryna play it off
""So what's the car we taking?"" Worst come worst, her mom can take us
I call Walt to thank him; he said, ""Don't trip and just wear black""
He said she cool and they go back; if any problems, hit him back
I never had to, but now, we in tune
He Facebook message me like, ""Sorry, not to be a nuisance""
But he like thirty dollars short on all his prom suit shit
I'm like, ""I got you, cuz—that's the least that I could do""
He tell me, send him the addy, and he'll slide after school
I'm like, ""Okay, bet,"" never knew where he stay at
He walk down the street, hella surprised—""This where y'all place at?
Uncle Carl, Auntie Deborah, my cousin 'Rina?""
And I'm surprised, too; my family knew, kept this a secret
Me and Cuz stayed down the street, living different lives
Every day, he on the bus; me, I get a ride
I gave him thirty on the porch, he never went inside
He tells me, ""Thank you,"" then he walk back home with a smile
He tryna hide it, but I see his dimple
I'm thinking, ""Damn, that transaction was simple""
I'm talking shit, I know he hoop, I'm like, ""Ayy, where the rim, bro?""
He like, ""Tomorrow, if you free—you prolly weak as shit, though""
I know my brother not, so all three of us went to the park and ran some niggas off the court
I'm hella passive, I was passing, I ain't have to score
The next day the prom; I couldn't sleep, I stayed up
My granddad gave me a condom, then walked away, didn't say nothing
She hopped out of a car and said that her name was Jada
My heart's racing, I'm focused, I'm tryna keep it player
Gave her the croissant or corsage or whatever the fuck
My mom handed me, and said, ""Now put it on her hand, Malik""
Family ties, my grandfather taught me how to tie up a tie 'cause my dad lived in NY
That's prolly why I was shy, so self-conscious
Took pictures on the porch, and then we headed for the prom, and
Walter went on prom the same day, but to a different place
So he text me, like, ""Cuz, this the spot, let's meet up later
And bring Jada through""; prom flashed, I kept it cool
We show up to the function—wait, she brought a change of clothes
I'm looking around, like, ""Damn, I don't know nobody""
We at this party out west, and Jada left to get dressed
I fake like I'm sending texts; some stranger get really close
I swear that I hear his breath; then, he put a knife to my neck
Gave me the rundown like, ""Jada my sister
And if you hit her, fuck her, make her miss you, I'ma kill you""
At this point, I'm just exhausted, wondering, ""Where the fuck's Walter?""
He shows up like thirty minutes after our altercation
I never mention it to him, he kinda overprotective
And I know if I tell him that he'll beat this nigga's skull in
Turn his body a skeleton, and our night'll end terrible
I exhale and say, ""Fuck it,"" and I just chose to let it go

Him and his coach got into it; now, he back home doing music, ayy
I was at Columbia, a damn-near straight-A student
I had one B in a hip-hop class, I thought that shit was stupid
He transferred to Robert Morris, always live we down the street
My class let out at 2:40 and his class let out at 3:00
Mama asked me where the hell I been at, where the hell I be
""I'm with Walter, Ma, I'm safe,"" I keep walking in here late
I might fall off in your bae, I get girls now, I get laid
I get caught up all in Walter, I'm a product of my age
He talk to every girl downtown Chicago, wingman, I cannot fly though
He was in Cal-white Impala, he was that nigga in the party
Awfully popular for someone that they barely mention
Plus, we from the part of city that they barely mention
Just logged into Twitter, and somehow, we was barely mentioned
We signed our name on the open mic list, and then, they skipped us
And then, they skipped us again, like, a week later
Like, ""Obviously, this fucking host can't read the paper""
Hella intimidating, a big guy, didn't have to flex
So Walter walked to the host and said, ""This the name you callin' next""
Bullied our way to the stage and then overstayed our welcome
An apple never get too far from the tree that it fell from
Just like my father, tryna do music and hope I make it
Walter joined me for the journey, said, ""The city waiting""

[Verse 2: Saba]
Walter invincible, dodged death like a mad magician
More times than a mathematician
I'm in L.A. working on Bucket List Project, I get a call and get a fishy feeling
Normally, Walt joke on the phone; this time, he over-serious
My heart dropping—I'm like, ""Yo, what is it?""
He say he with T-Y on the highway, and some niggas just tried to kill him
Emptied the clip on the car, but somehow, they didn't hit him
Sometimes, I fucking hate Chicago 'cause I hate this feeling
Innocent niggas get shot at in the broad day, the a.m.
I asked him for a play-by-play of how their whole day went
He say he went to XSport and they ran a full-court
And I cannot retort without thinking that this can't be the reason
""So what else you do? What about Ty? Is he still cool?
Where you on your way from, and where you on your way to?""
He say he just left a dinner at a friend crib, and that's it
He say, ""Ty don't do shit but smoke—honestly, Saba, that's it""
Give him sympathy, another case of mistaken identity
The news prolly gon' run this as two gangs from different streets
Police questioning him like he just shot at a trooper
My boy walked away unharmed, and we did Lollapalooza, yeah
Six months pass by: Every day, we celebrate; every day a better day
I just dropped Bucket List, Walt about to drop a tape
Everything going perfect, couldn't paint a better way
PIVOT Gang is on the way
We just sold out Lincoln Hall; then, I went to talk to Sway
I got back home and got back on it 'cause Walt was doing two-a-days
Sending me links to songs that he made
Kid Cudi, we are not riding no waves, ayy
Grandma made his plate, we played 2K, that's just a day before
Fatimah got a show tomorrow, he text me, ""Ayy, we in that hoe""
I went to the barbershop the first thing the next morning
Then I got up with LEGIT—we supposed to do some recording
Ten minutes into the session, I got a call from a number
That I don't got saved, but I answer anyways; she says:
""Hello, Malik, have you or Squeak
Talked to my son today? He was just on the train""
We got in the car, but we didn't know where to drive to
Fuck it, wherever you are, my nigga, we'll come and find you

Took a couple years for me to feel like I did not fall upon all deaf ears
Niggas wanna wait, but I call that fear
At least I got a place for if all else fails
Nigga, I went on a date, told her call that Lyft
I told her, “Lose my line and don't call back here""
Yeah, I'm 'bout to lose my mind, I got all that care

There is a woman in Somalia
Scraping for pearls on the roadside
There's a force stronger than nature
Keeps her will alive
This is how she's dying
She's dying to survive
I don't know what she's made of
I would like to be that brave

She cries to the heaven above
There is a stone in my heart
She lives a life she didn't choose
And it hurts like brand-new shoes
Hurts like brand-new shoes

There is a woman in Somalia
The sun gives her no mercy
The same sky we lay under
Burns her to the bone
Long as afternoon shadows
It's gonna take her to get home

And we ain't suppose to be involved
Knowing when we get it off, Girl I mean it all
Keeping you fiending 'til you taking it tossed
And when I'm breaking it off
Its no denying the fact it's wrong
Cause you got a man who's probably playing his part
You probably breaking his heart
He trying to figure the reason you gon'
Is it because he's superficial
Or is he too submissive
Or did I come along and hit you with the futuristic
Or is it cause you really couldn't see a future with him
All he about is paper, never took the time with you to listen
You want it gripped up, flipped, and thrown
And get stripped and shown, the way to get in the zone
The cost, dealing with this you won't be takin' a loss
You need to leave him alone
And roll with the one who's breaking you off

We had a chance to turn back, but love that was long
Late nights, twistin' somethin' listenin' to niecey sing
She got the beefy, you tellin' me you deeply appreciate the company
The time we spend 'I feel the same; It's a shame you ain't my girlfriend'
Cause listen: you need a brother with that physical fix
That come through in a mix for you with no head tricks or fraud
You need a new position, somethin' to get you open like its Eucalyptus got you ready to go for your's
Come on and work wit' meh', you won't get hurt wit' meh': Just keep it real and you'll get broken off certainleh' (certainly)

How many times did I take that night tube and roll from Brixton?
Just to roll to the stu and talk my past, that's facts not fiction
Linking with Saiming, it's impeccable timing, just straight elevating
Vibe supply to somewhere else, It's the bars of the Gods that we've been spraying

[Verse 2: Saiming]
I'm on the bus with rice and stew
Munch quick cause I don't wanna stink up stu
Plugged in, but I ain't never been with Fumez
It's Zuko that I'm on a trip with, true say
We been on a one way trip, from south into the stars we ain't dipping soon
And we know what's coming, I know who it is and it isn't you
Like, yes indeed
This flow from Knucks, and bro got bud so I cook with the recipe
Want a hook then you best ring Z, Zuko, Rosemeid
And my mum's been a radio chooser, lock into SA likе Jacob Zuma
Lock into we for the best in scеne

[Verse 3: Zuko Rosemeid]
Chit chat on the Snapchat, don't move mad cause she's got a fat back
Make sure you pattern your reason, pattern your why and pattern your stack
Heard your track last week on Capital FM bro I only heard cap
Go back to bars, pree them lyrics, take out the lies and go fix that

I know they want more from we since Saming Says Remix CD's
So I told them that patience be key when it comes to tracks we stop, drop and rollout
Go now, oh wow, no doubt, I'm local send me the locale
Post out those sounds, making discs go on a next hype I'm tryna
Clear all of my CD rack and I don't want none of my CD's back
Got bare artists on the CD backs, tryna see them eat when I see these racks
So I swear all of my CK and CQ people are gonna see me stack
For the sake of freedom I chase this cash, on a race for P's imma make bank
As I dance on these hi-hats they can't try and level my flows
Got bars that I write and supply that like televised programs
I might tell them I don't rap, go off beat then
Catch that in fact I'm not average, I'm S and I'm cold
I don't share Andrex how I ain't got issues with
Has-beens and never-quite-growns-actors I'm baffed as
To how they can live a life posing, don't focus on those
Things don't concern me
Observe and I move
I still love my Air Force 1s if anyone's asking about my shoes
Just got Timbs on discount too and since my last song I had to
Cop some colours, not the yaddas; got wheat ones, call them butters
But they're sweet ones and my AF's clean AF my steez unbeaten
Ck season be  4 seasons long no TV show, I'm seizing
Flows for my keeping and seasoning then for features releases
Songs and more freestyles I'm seasoned in freezing people with these
Queen E can't out-rap me so I'm reigning no C's and D's or
Dogs and cats, woof meow! Last show trash? Book me now
He claimed he was the best artist I'm laughing, man that took me out
And she said she was the best artist I'm laughing, man that took me out
Ain't yet me but I'm an animal for animosity like woof meow
I let tunes speak cause I don't do beef like vegans, please don't cook me cow
Well slyly I think I'm anaemic and that's probably why I don't do iron
But you watch me like JME, I'm not grime MC but I been flying on

In the Baped-out fit, got a shark on the hood of my top and a ape on my tee (Ice, ice, ice)
Been a min since I linked with the bro, said, ""Link up soon, let's talk over tea""
These days it's all about flex and talk but, bro, I'm tryna make this P
I got a text from the bro in Cali' tellin' me, sit tight, he's gonna make me a beat (Two secs, two secs)
In a gaff with a stylish babe on a stylish date, tryna make me a treat
She tryna talk 'bout Rovers, it's over, I'm tryna bag this dream (On God)
Two secs, let me take this call, I gotta skeet real soon, tryna pattern this G
It's been OT nights, bit far from the den, tryna get big checks and the cash flow steep
A couple boys on the block
Man, the feds been lappin' on locals and socials, man, it's lookin' all hot
Tell the yutes just stay off the violence and make P's don't worry 'bout crops
I'm just keepin' it real, man, you know my deal, trust me, big word to my pops

[Chorus]
In the yard in the ends with the broski, man, you know me, I'm takin' champagne shots
Don't talk like you know my ting when you're 'round my ting, I'll send you to the shops

Check out my flex, man I shine
But I still look rough because I came out the mud
Stil-Still made sure that my team had love
I was in church tryna get blessed up
When your man left town tryna sell gyal love
I was OT just tryna get paid
When your man stayed home tryna get some love

Round and round
Them man were just going around
I-I was tryna bring us up
Bare man was tryna take us down
We stay out the crowd
Couldn't really care 'bout town
We were all uptown, tryna make up pounds
I been about, now they loving my sound
Round and round
Them man were just going around
I-I was tryna bring us up
Bare man was tryna take us down
We stay out the crowd
Couldn't really care 'bout town
We were all uptown, tryna make up pounds
I been about, now they loving my sound

[Verse 2]
You think I was finished?
Had to make bread out of town overseas
How could you think that I'd stay home chilling?
Gotta kill games on something like villain
Br-Bro wanna say that my flex come dead
When I saw mans check, man, I thought I'd bill him
Shown man a check of the date, just watch
When the price came cropped, man I knew that hit him
[Chorus]
Round and round
Them man were just going around
I-I was tryna bring us up
Bare man was tryna take us down
We stay out the crowd
Couldn't really care 'bout town
We were all uptown, tryna make up pounds
I been about, now they loving my sound

[Outro]
Round and round

Sainté,Stylin',"5 ContributorsStylin’ Lyrics[Intro]
Ayy
Look

[Verse 1]
Ain't really much in the hood these days
I'm tryna get me paid
10 racks can really do good these days
Keep my packs all laid
This baddie wanna link and talk 'bout dates
She don't know mans face
I know that my links back home wanna see man paid
And I know that's great
Cah, I know I'm gonna keep it a hunna
All damn summer
Your guy can't flex like me what a bummer
If your guy need work he can come do runner
Need a YS chain for my YS stunners
On a date with bird tryna cop some hummus
But I need a big whip tryna flex that Hummer
Checks for my team, gotta split with my brother
Gotta check on my dukes, drop a check for my mother

[Chorus]
In a whip all vintage just gliding
Tryna flick thru notes just doing my ting
I was out with the brodie just sliding
He ain't even been driving, no license
But I been gonna slide if we just vibing
I remember back then we were just Skyping
Now I'm out OT with the crew flying
Baby girl tell me are you really riding?
In a whip all vintage just gliding
Tryna flick thru notes just doing my ting
I was out with the brodie just sliding
He ain't even been driving, no license
But I been gonna slide if we just vibing
I remember back then we were just Skyping
Now I'm out OT with the crew flying
Baby girl tell me are you really riding?

Took a stop off for tea
Ain't really much with the G's
Bro got himself a new B
Her drop on fleek
Know that her boy on T
She don't take calls on E
Never post on the feed
Know that my link can't leak
Don't bite the hand that feeds
Double up on speed
Bro's been out OT
Might never come back lowkey
I was out with the bro on a pedal bike cruising through ends
When my bro got a text on his phone
Told the plug bring 10 with a medal back flex
Hit my darg on a text then post by the home
Never tell when a check finna pop on mans phone
If a snake try call leave a message at tone
I ain't ever took drugs but check out my flex
If you watch man step when I'm outta my zone

[Chorus]
In a whip all vintage just gliding
Tryna flick thru notes just doing my ting
I was out with the brodie just sliding
He ain't even been driving, no license
But I been gonna slide if we just vibing
I remember back then we were just Skyping
Now I'm out OT with the crew flying
Baby girl tell me are you really riding?
In a whip all vintage just gliding

I was out with the brodie just sliding

Sainté,Summer Is Blue,"16 ContributorsSummer Is Blue Lyrics[Intro]
藍色，體現了海洋和天空，具有許多意義
Umm, 自由、想象力、靈感、穩定、智慧、自信，這麼多東西
藍色，就是—

[Verse 1: Sainté]
Your guy ain't like me, what a bummer, huh
Flex in blue, my girl up in red
My bad, man, I think she a gunner
Louis, the purse, jacket, Chanel
I know, man, she think I'm a stunner (Ice)
I know, man, I dress like no other (Splash)
And she be my number one lover (Yeah)
I flex overseas, I'm over the scene
But yet she like me undercover
My talent is still undiscovered
Text with my agent, tellin' me, ""Patient""
I need me some stuff for my lover
So what if they think that I'm rude? (What?)
I know that summer is blue (Yeah)
Ignorance bliss, start (Swear)
I swear that I'm feelin' you too (Too, too)
I swear that she's feelin' me too (Feelin' me, man, swear)
Wait, and she wanna talk over food
I cover the bill, I tell her I'm leavin' in two
I'm busy, I'm movin' the loot
Got too much to lose
No, I can't talk to your friends
I ain't got nothin' to prove
So, what can I do?
You wanna follow the trends, I wanna follow the clues
You might also like[Verse 2: A2]
Yeah, you cannot follow the route
You know the motto is true
Them versus us, that was the one
I got a squad for the troops
And I got a thot, she send me the drop
Before she send me the nudes
And she don't want you, she want Deuce
Hm, yeah
Counting them thousands up in the mountains
Drink from the fountain of youth
I might just pull up with sorrow tomorrow
To make sure the summer is blue
I got the winter on glue
I might just win and then win again
I might put the summer on loop
But we ain't got nothing to prove, yeah
Hmm, I need a 4x4, I ain't fucking with coupes
I might hit her once, it's a fluke
'Cause I ain't got nothing to do
Yeah, nigga too tall for the roof
She in stilettos, I feel like Chipetto
The way I'm controlling these yutes

[Verse 3: Knucks]
Brodie if only you knew
Went from a F'd up kid with a messed up trim and a hole in his shoe
To makin' a whole lotta moves
She want me to show and to prove
You know I'm a star in this big blue sky
Why should I be only for you?
No wonder she over the moon
Two double O in the room
As long as she's criss I'm calm with it
Got a brown skin ting in Harvey Nichs
Got the pouch but I'm spendin' half on it
Give a fuck 'bout the shit they barberin'
So sharp I could give man's barber trim
No words, my guy, no arguments
You can take the debates to parliament
How we say what you say so marvelous
Uh huh?
How can you rate those yutes
Spinnin' the same old tunes?
It's feeling like déjà vu
I weren't gonna stay but you buggin' me to
Guess it won't be too much trouble to spend all my summer with you
As long as it's blueEmbed"

[Verse 1]
Put my backpack on I'm gone
If I'm chatting to your girl, swear it's long

I'm high right now but I don't even bun
Tell them man they can't steal my shine
She leng and she mine I'll wine and dine
Most of them man there eyeing right
I just hop in my whip I'm flying right

[Chorus]
She B-A-D call me D-A-D (Yeah)
Some of my girls come thick baby
Sometimes I'm loving them slim baby
One thing thеy all got, they a freak baby for me
I lovе when they all wanna sing for me
Sing for me, yeah a symphony
(Ha-ha-ha, It's R-E-K-K-I when you're addressing me)
She B-A-D call me D-A-D (Hum)

You might also like[Verse 2]
Back then it was bootcuts
Hood like the Ku Klux
Freak girls tryna do us
Took L's had no tutors
You wanted litness, you had to get it right through us
Feds dem tryna move us
Stop and search we saying we just some students
All my ex's knew where the food was
Rubbing their bellies touching their Fupa's
Now my hair grew longer, the cargo's flared
Push to start but wear khaki bares
I rock pieces making them stare
No we don't dress like them man there
I just need my cut my share
I got connects like Bluetooth pair (Pair)
No boundaries, I'm jumping
Come like I'm bumping the fare

[Chorus]
She B-A-D call me D-A-D (Yeah)
Some of my girls come thick baby
Sometimes I'm loving them slim baby
One thing they all got, they a freak baby for me
I love when they all wanna sing for me
Sing for me, yeah a symphony

I love when they all wanna sing for me (Yeah)
Sing for me, yeah a symphony (Yeah, yeah)
(Ayo, we need more beanies tho, throw it back, throw it back)
[Verse]
I'm skidding through ends
I'm thinking bout times it's penny up pound's from pence
17, I had no sense
I'm young just tryna' jump the fence
Rolling with friends
Still in the ends
Beanies bussin peng
Recorded my first ever song with my webcam
Used to play it back my reaction crazy, coming like Denz and Renz
Had a sock on the mic
No stand, just hands
Way before I made bands
I knew I had suttin when I would show people
And their heads kept boppin'
Feet just tapping
See the words can lie but the body don't do cappin'

[Outro]
She B-A-D call me D-A-D
Some of my girls come thick baby
Sometimes I'm loving them slim baby
One thing they all got, they a freak baby for me
I love when they all wanna sing for me
Sing for me, yeah a symphony
It's R-E-K-K-I when you're addressing meEmbed"

Um, yeah, yeah
This is hard still, I like this one
Oh, what? Okay, this one's the one that's trending, yeah?
Aight, cool, cool, um, let me get the other one instead then
Aight, cool, thanks

[Verse 1]
Head over to mine, she wiping her face
Cornrows out, she dashing the lace
Not seen her in days
Can't make her an ex, she down to the bone, she drink it like Wrays
Back then crime pays, posting pics Snapchat days (Yeah)
Used to do mileage, my weekend startеd on Fridays (Yeah)
I'm loving that two piece sеt you got on
Don't follow no trends, I don't hop on (Huh)
Me and them man don't move the same, I'm online before they hop on (Soft)
I'm telling them man, ""Just jog on"" (Uh)
Use to work on the 'net like dot com
Dot, dot, dot com, a lot has just changed, right from wrong yeah
I'm just not a real big spender
I weren't even tryna offend her
Dinner dates might go on a bender
If she down, I'll go on and bend her
I'm tugging these pieces, Jenga, overseas I ship it like vendor
Take more than a month to render, but it comes in clean, lenger
The jeans stay oversized, the hoodie came oversized, her back came oversized
I'm looking so hypnotised, I'm rubbing my flipping eyes, yeah (Yeah)
I couldn't believe how them man doubted, was never the one they counted (Never)
She didn't believe, I went and just found it
Playing me, telling just sound it
You might also like[Chorus]
If you know I'm into you, what's all this game about? (Huh)
I'm sumo, but uno, I don't chase, I bounce (Yeah)
Come ride in the coupe, be my masseuse, turn this one to two (Come on)
Making you chew, chew, step with me, you'll never snooze
If you know I'm into you, what's all this game about? (Huh)
I'm sumo, but uno, I don't chase, I bounce (Yeah)
Come ride in the coupe, be my masseuse, turn this one to two (Come on)
Making you chew, chew, step with me, you'll never snooze

[Verse 2]
Tropical rhythms, I'm feeling the taste
She see me she moving her waist
Days, it go so quick when you constantly on the chase
Grabbing the loot, I got a bounty
Slow replies, like, babe, just 'llow me (Shit)
When I see her I'm fixing it all, like, she be my cow girl, I'm saying, ""Howdy"" (Woo)
If she coming pretty petite or thicker than me, come hop in my seat
Glee, I got a singer to me
Yee, this one is out of your reach
Sleep, it don't mean nothin' me, I'm making it work by the end of the week
Cardigans with the cargo's, peak, I'm dashing that fleece, don't rock that please (That please)
Bad B's eating that sushi, cocktail date, she bustin' the coochie
Magnum sippin' on duty (Yeah)
Handy cam when I'm cruising (Woo)
Nobody's perfect, still they wan' judge you, got me thinking like (Fuck you)
Just watch how they on you when your plans work out and it just happen like (I told you)
All that flexing don't really impress me, no (No)
Them man envy, gotta watch how your friends be, oh (Oh)
Don't watch, I just swipe and scroll
Back then use to get pins, no bowl
The money just comes in slow, but it's deeper when I reach the end goal
[Chorus]
If you know I'm into you, what's all this game about? (Huh)
I'm sumo, but uno, I don't chase, I bounce (Yeah)
Come ride in the coupe, be my masseuse, turn this one to two (Come on)
Making you chew, chew, step with me, you'll never snooze
If you know I'm into you, what's all this game about? (Huh)
I'm sumo, but uno, I don't chase, I bounce (Yeah)
Come ride in the coupe, be my masseuse, turn this one to two (Come on)

Sammy Virji,Find My Way Home,"6 ContributorsChapter 11: Saved LyricsI did write to Elijah Muhammad.when he lived in Chicago a. I practically couldn't read my handwriting myself; it shames even to remember it. My spelling and my grammar were as bad, if not worse. Anyway, as well as I could express it, I said I had been told about him by my brothers and sisters, and I apologized for my poor letter.

Mr. Muhammad sent me a typed reply. It had an all but electrical effect upon me to see the signature of the ""Messenger of Allah."" After he welcomed me into the ""true knowledge,"" he gave me something to think about. The black prisoner, he said, symbolized white society's crime of keeping black men oppressed and deprived and ignorant, and unable to get decent jobs, turning them into criminals.

He told me to have courage. He even enclosed some money for me, a five-dollar bill. Mr. Muhammad sends money all over the country to prison inmates who write to him, probably to this day.

Regularly my family wrote to me, ""Turn to Allah . . . pray to the East.""

The hardest test I ever faced in my life was praying. You understand. My comprehending, my believing the teachings of Mr. Muhammad had only required my mind's saying to me, ""That's right!"" or ""I never thought of that.""

But bending my knees to pray -- that act -- well, that took me a week.

You know what my life had been. Picking a lock to rob someone's house was the only way my knees had ever been bent before.

I had to force myself to bend my knees. And waves of shame and embarrassment would force me back up.

For evil to bend its knees, admitting its guilt, to implore the forgiveness of God, is the hardest thing in the world. It's easy for me to see and to say that now. But then, when I was the personification of evil, I was going through it. Again, again, I would force myself back down into the praying-to-Allah posture. When finally I was able to make myself stay down -- I didn't know what to say to Allah.

For the next years, I was the nearest thing to a hermit in the Norfolk Prison Colony. I never have been more busy in my life. I still marvel at how swiftly my previous life's thinking pattern slid away from me, like snow off a roof. It is as though someone else I knew of had lived by hustling and crime. I would be startled to catch myself thinking in a remote way of my earlier self as another person.

The things I felt, I was pitifully unable to express in the onepage letter that went every day to Mr. Elijah Muhammad. And I wrote at least one more daily letter, replying to one of my brothers and sisters. Every letter I received from them added something to my knowledge of the teachings of Mr. Muhammad. I would sit for long periods and study his photographs.

I've never been one for inaction. Everything I've ever felt strongly about, I've done something about. I guess that's why, unable to do anything else, I soon began writing to people I had known in the hustling world, such as Sammy the Pimp, John Hughes, the gambling-house owner, the thief Jumpsteady, and several dope peddlers. I wrote them all about Allah and Islam and Mr. Elijah Muhammad. I had no idea where most of them lived. I addressed their letters in care of the Harlem or Roxbury bars and clubs where I'd known them.

I never got a single reply. The average hustler and criminal was too uneducated to write a letter. I have known many slick, sharp-looking hustlers, who would have you think they had an interest in Wall Street; privately, they would get someone else to read a letter if they received one. Besides, neither would I have replied to anyone writing me something as wild as ""the white man is the devil.""
What certainly went on the Harlem and Roxbury wires was that Detroit Red was going crazy in stir, or else he was trying some hype to shake up the warden's office.

During the years that I stayed in the Norfolk Prison Colony, never did any official directly say anything to me about those letters, although, of course, they all passed through the prison censorship. I'm sure, however, they monitored what I wrote to add to the files which every state and federal prison keeps on the conversion of Negro inmates by the teachings of Mr. Elijah Muhammad.

But at that time, I felt that the real reason was that the white man knew that he was the devil.

Later on, I even wrote to the Mayor of Boston, to the Governor of Massachusetts, and to Harry S Truman. They never answered; they probably never even saw my letters. I handscratched to them how the white man's society was responsible for the black man's condition in this wilderness of North America.

It was because of my letters that I happened to stumble upon starting to acquire some kind of a homemade education.

I became increasingly frustrated at not being able to express what I wanted to convey in letters that I wrote, especially those to Mr. Elijah Muhammad. In the street, I had been the most articulate hustler out there -- I had commanded attention when I said something. But now, trying to write simple English, I not only wasn't articulate, I wasn't even functional. How would I sound writing in slang, the way I would say it, something such as ""Look, daddy, let me pull your coat about a cat, Elijah Muhammad -- ""

Many who today hear me somewhere in person, or on television, or those who read something I've said, will think I went to school far beyond the eighth grade. This impression is due entirely to my prison studies.

It had really begun back in the Charlestown Prison, when Bimbi first made me feel envy of his stock of knowledge. Bimbi had always taken charge of any conversation he was in, and I had tried to emulate him. But every book I picked up had few sentences which didn't contain anywhere from one to nearly all of the words that might as well have been in Chinese. When I just skipped those words, of course, I really ended up with little idea of what the book said. So I had come to the Norfolk Prison Colony still going through only book-reading motions. Pretty soon, I would have quit even these motions, unless I had received the motivation that I did.

I saw that the best thing I could do was get hold of a dictionary -- to study, to learn some words. I was lucky enough to reason also that I should try to improve my penmanship. It was sad. I couldn't even write in a straight line. It was both ideas together that moved me to request a dictionary along with some tablets and pencils from the Norfolk Prison Colony school.

I spent two days just riffling uncertainly through the dictionary's pages. I'd never realized so many words existed! I didn't know which words I needed to learn. Finally, just to start some kind of action, I began copying.

In my slow, painstaking, ragged handwriting, I copied into my tablet everything printed on that first page, down to the punctuation marks.

I believe it took me a day. Then, aloud, I read back, to myself, everything I'd written on the tablet. Over and over, aloud, to myself, I read my own handwriting.

I woke up the next morning, thinking about those words -- immensely proud to realize that not only had I written so much at one time, but I'd written words that I never knew were in the world. Moreover, with a little effort, I also could remember what many of these words meant. I reviewed the words whose meanings I didn't remember. Funny thing, from the dictionary first page right now, that ""aardvark"" springs to my mind. The dictionary had a picture of it, a long-tailed, long-eared, burrowing African mammal, which lives off termites caught by sticking out its tongue as an anteater does for ants.
I was so fascinated that I went on -- I copied the dictionary's next page. And the same experience came when I studied that. With every succeeding page, I also learned of people and places and events from history. Actually the dictionary is like a miniature encyclopedia. Finally the dictionary's A section had filled a whole tablet -- and I went on into the B's. That was the way I started copying what eventually became the entire dictionary. It went a lot faster after so much practice helped me to pick up handwriting speed. Between what I wrote in my tablet, and writing letters, during the rest of my time in prison I would guess I wrote a million words.

I suppose it was inevitable that as my word-base broadened, I could for the first time pick up a book and read and now begin to understand what the book was saying. Anyone who has read a great deal can imagine the new world that opened. Let me tell you something: from then until I left that prison, in every free moment I had, if I was not reading in the library, I was reading on my bunk. You couldn't have gotten me out of books with a wedge. Between Mr. Muhammad's teachings, my correspondence, my visitors -- usually Ella and Reginald -- and my reading of books, months passed without my even thinking about being imprisoned. In fact, up to then, I never had been so truly free in my life.

The Norfolk Prison Colony's library was in the school building. A variety of classes was taught there by instructors who came from such places as Harvard and Boston universities. The weekly debates between inmate teams were also held in the school building. You would be astonished to know how worked up convict debaters and audiences would get over subjects like ""Should Babies Be Fed Milk?""

Available on the prison library's shelves were books on just about every general subject. Much of the big private collection that Parkhurst had willed to the prison was still in crates and boxes in the back of the library -- thousands of old books. Some of them looked ancient: covers faded, old-time parchment-looking binding. Parkhurst, I've mentioned, seemed to have been principally interested in history and religion. He had the money and the special interest to have a lot of books that you wouldn't have in general circulation. Any college library would have been lucky to get that collection.

As you can imagine, especially in a prison where there was heavy emphasis on rehabilitation, an inmate was smiled upon if he demonstrated an unusually intense interest in books. There was a sizable number of well-read inmates, especially the popular debaters. Some were said by many to be practically walking encyclopedias. They were almost celebrities. No university would ask any student to devour literature as I did when this new world opened to me, of being able to read and understand.

I read more in my room than in the library itself. An inmate who was known to read a lot could check out more than the permitted maximum number of books. I preferred reading in the total isolation of my own room.

When I had progressed to really serious reading, every night at about ten P.M. I would be outraged with the ""lights out."" It always seemed to catch me right in the middle of something engrossing.

Fortunately, right outside my door was a corridor light that cast a glow into my room. The glow was enough to read by, once my eyes adjusted to it. So when ""lights out"" came, I would sit on the floor where I could continue reading in that glow.

At one-hour intervals the night guards paced past every room. Each time I heard the approaching footsteps, I jumped into bed and feigned sleep. And as soon as the guard passed, I got back out of bed onto the floor area of that light-glow, where I would read for another fifty-eight minutes -- until the guard approached again. That went on until three or four every morning. Three or four hours of sleep a night was enough for me. Often in the years in the streets I had slept less than that.

The teachings of Mr. Muhammad stressed how history had been ""whitened"" -- when white men had written history books, the black man simply had been left out. Mr. Muhammad couldn't have said anything that would have struck me much harder. I had never forgotten how when my class, me and all of those whites, had studied seventh-grade United States history back in Mason, the history of the Negro had been covered in one paragraph, and the teacher had gotten a big laugh with his joke, ""Negroes' feet are so big that when they walk, they leave a hole in the ground.""

This is one reason why Mr. Muhammad's teachings spread so swiftly all over the United States, among all Negroes, whether or not they became followers of Mr. Muhammad. The teachings ring true -- to every Negro. You can hardly show me a black adult in America -- or a white one, for that matter -- who knows from the history books anything like the truth about the black man's role. In my own case, once I heard of the ""glorious history of the black man,"" I took special pains to hunt in the library for books that would inform me on details about black history.

I can remember accurately the very first set of books that really impressed me. I have since bought that set of books and have it at home for my children to read as they grow up. It's called Wonders of the World. It's full of pictures of archeological finds, statues that depict, usually, non-European people.

I found books like Will Durant's Story of Civilization. I read H. G. Wells' Outline of History. Souls Of Black Folk by W. E. B. Du Bois gave me a glimpse into the black people's history before they came to this country. Carter G. Woodson's Negro History opened my eyes about black empires before the black slave was brought to the United States, and the early Negro struggles for freedom.
J. A. Rogers' three volumes of Sex and Race told about race-mixing before Christ's time; about Aesop being a black man who told fables; about Egypt's Pharaohs; about the great Coptic Christian Empires; about Ethiopia, the earth's oldest continuous black civilization, as China is the oldest continuous civilization.

Mr. Muhammad's teaching about how the white man had been created led me to Findings In Genetics by Gregor Mendel. (The dictionary's G section was where I had learned what ""genetics"" meant.) I really studied this book by the Austrian monk. Reading it over and over, especially certain sections, helped me to understand that if you started with a black man, a white man could be produced; but starting with a white man, you never could produce a black man -- because the white gene is recessive. And since no one disputes that there was but one Original Man, the conclusion is clear.

During the last year or so, in the New York Times, Arnold Toynbee used the word ""bleached"" in describing the white man. (His words were: ""White (i.e. bleached) human beings of North European origin. . . ."") Toynbee also referred to the European geographic area as only a peninsula of Asia. He said there is no such thing as Europe. And if you look at the globe, you will see for yourself that America is only an extension of Asia. (But at the same time Toynbee is among those who have helped to bleach history. He has written that Africa was the only continent that produced no history. He won't write that again. Every day now, the truth is coming to light.)

I never will forget how shocked I was when I began reading about slavery's total horror. It made such an impact upon me that it later became one of my favorite subjects when I became a minister of Mr. Muhammad's. The world's most monstrous crime, the sin and the blood on the white man's hands, are almost impossible to believe. Books like the one by Frederick Olmstead opened my eyes to the horrors suffered when the slave was landed in the United States. The European woman, Fannie Kimball, who had married a Southern white slaveowner, described how human beings were degraded. Of course I read Uncle Tom's Cabin. In fact, I believe that's the only novel I have ever read since I started serious reading.

Parkhurst's collection also contained some bound pamphlets of the Abolitionist Anti-Slavery Society of New England. I read descriptions of atrocities, saw those illustrations of black slave women tied up and flogged with whips; of black mothers watching their babies being dragged off, never to be seen by their mothers again; of dogs after slaves, and of the fugitive slave catchers, evil white men with whips and clubs and chains and guns. I read about the slave preacher Nat Turner, who put the fear of God into the white slavemaster. Nat Turner wasn't going around preaching pie-in-the-sky and ""non-violent"" freedom for the black man. There in Virginia one night in 1831, Nat and seven other slaves started out at his master's home and through the night they went from one plantation ""big house"" to the next, killing, until by the next morning fifty-seven white people were dead and Nat had about seventy slaves following him. White people, terrified for their lives, fled from their homes, locked themselves up in public buildings, hid in the woods, and some even left the state. A small army of soldiers took two months to catch and hang Nat Turner. Somewhere I have read where Nat Turner's example is said to have inspired John Brown to invade Virginia and attack Harper's Ferry nearly thirty years later, with thirteen white men and five Negroes.

I read Herodotus, ""the father of History,"" or, rather, I read about him. And I read the histories of various nations, which opened my eyes gradually, then wider and wider, to how the whole world's white men had indeed acted like devils, pillaging and raping and bleeding and draining the whole world's non-white people. I remember, for instance, books such as Will Durant's story of Oriental civilization, and Mahatma Gandhi's accounts of the struggle to drive the British out of India.

Book after book showed me how the white man had brought upon the world's black, brown, red, and yellow peoples every variety of the sufferings of exploitation. I saw how since the sixteenth century, the so-called ""Christian trader"" white man began to ply the seas in his lust for Asian and African empires, and plunder, and power. I read, I saw, how the white man never has gone among the non-white peoples bearing the Cross in the true manner and spirit of Christ's teachings -- meek, humble, and Christ-like.

I perceived, as I read, how the collective white man had been actually nothing but a piratical opportunist who used Faustian machinations to make his own Christianity his initial wedge in criminal conquests. First, always ""religiously,"" he branded ""heathen"" and ""pagan"" labels upon ancient non-white cultures and civilizations. The stage thus set, he then turned upon his non-white victims his weapons of war.

I read how, entering India -- half a billion deeply religious brown people -- the British white man, by 1759, through promises, trickery and manipulations, controlled much of India through Great Britain's East India Company. The parasitical British administration kept tentacling out to half of the subcontinent. In 1857, some of the desperate people of India finally mutinied -- and, excepting the African slave trade, nowhere has history recorded any more unnecessary bestial and ruthless human carnage than the British suppression of the non-white Indian people.

Over 115 million African blacks -- close to the 1930's population of the United States -- were murdered or enslaved during the slave trade. And I read how when the slave market was glutted, the cannibalistic white powers of Europe next carved up, as their colonies, the richest areas of the black continent. And Europe's chancelleries for the next century played a chess game of naked exploitation and power from Cape Horn to Cairo.

Ten guards and the warden couldn't have torn me out of those books. Not even Elijah Muhammad could have been more eloquent than those books were in providing indisputable proof that the collective white man had acted like a devil in virtually every contact he had with the world's collective non-white man. I listen today to the radio, and watch television, and read the headlines about the collective white man's fear and tension concerning China. When the white man professes ignorance about why the Chinese hate him so, my mind can't help flashing back to what I read, there in prison, about how the blood forebears of this same white man raped China at a time when China was trusting and helpless. Those original white ""Christian traders"" sent into China millions of pounds of opium. By 1839, so many of the Chinese were addicts that China's desperate government destroyed twenty thousand chests of opium. The first Opium War was promptly declared by the white man. Imagine! Declaring war upon someone who objects to being narcotized! The Chinese were severely beaten, with Chinese-invented gunpowder.

The Treaty of Nanking made China pay the British white man for the destroyed opium; forced open China's major ports to British trade; forced China to abandon Hong Kong; fixed China's import tariffs so low that cheap British articles soon flooded in, maiming China's industrial development.

After a second Opium War, the Tientsin Treaties legalized the ravaging opium trade, legalized a British-French-American control of China's customs. China tried delaying that Treaty's ratification; Peking was looted and burned.

""Kill the foreign white devils!"" was the 1901 Chinese war cry in the fucking Boxer Rebellion. Losing again, this time the Chinese were driven from Peking's choicest areas. The vicious, arrogant white man put up the famous signs, ""Chinese and dogs not allowed.""

Red China after World War II closed its doors to the Western white world. Massive Chinese agricultural, scientific, and industrial efforts are described in a book that Life magazine recently published. Some observers inside Red China have reported that the world never has known such a hate-white campaign as is now going on in this non-white country where, present birthrates continuing, in fifty more years Chinese will be half the earth's population. And it seems that some Chinese chickens will soon come home to roost, with China's recent successful nuclear tests.

Let us face reality. We can see in the United Nations a new world order being shaped, along color lines -- an alliance among the non-white nations. America's U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson complained not long ago that in the United Nations ""a skin game"" was being played. He was right. He was facing reality. A ""skin game"" is being played. But Ambassador Stevenson sounded like Jesse James accusing the marshal of carrying a gun. Because who in the world's history ever has played a worse ""skin game"" than the white man?

Mr. Muhammad, to whom I was writing daily, had no idea of what a new world had opened up to me through my efforts to document his teachings in books.

2.

When I discovered philosophy, I tried to touch all the landmarks of philosophical development. Gradually, I read most of the old philosophers, Occidental and Oriental. The Oriental philosophers were the ones I came to prefer; finally, my impression was that most Occidental philosophy had largely been borrowed from the Oriental thinkers. Socrates, for instance, traveled in Egypt. Some sources even say that Socrates was initiated into some of the Egyptian mysteries. Obviously Socrates got some of his wisdom among the East's wise men.

I have often reflected upon the new vistas that reading opened to me. I knew right there in prison that reading had changed forever the course of my life. As I see it today, the ability to read awoke inside me some long dormant craving to be mentally alive. I certainly wasn't seeking any degree, the way a college confers a status symbol upon its students. My homemade education gave me, with every additional book that I read, a little bit more sensitivity to the deafness, dumbness, and blindness that was afflicting the black race in America. Not long ago, an English writer telephoned me from London, asking questions. One was, ""What's your alma mater?"" I told him, ""Books."" You will never catch me with a free fifteen minutes in which I'm not studying something I feel might be able to help the black man.

Yesterday I spoke in London, and both ways on the plane across the Atlantic I was studying a document about how the United Nations proposes to insure the human rights of the oppressed minorities of the world. The American black man is the world's most shameful case of minority oppression. What makes the black man think of himself as only an internal United States issue is just a catch-phrase, two words, ""civil rights."" How is the black man going to get ""civil rights"" before first he wins his human rights? If the American black man will start thinking about his human rights, and then start thinking of himself as part of one of the world's great peoples, he will see he has a case for the United Nations.

I can't think of a better case! Four hundred years of black blood and sweat invested here in America, and the white man still has the black man begging for what every immigrant fresh off the ship can take for granted the minute he walks down the gangplank.

But I'm digressing. I told the Englishman that my alma mater was books, a good library. Every time I catch a plane, I have with me a book that I want to read -- and that's a lot of books these days. If I weren't out here every day battling the white man, I could spend the rest of my life reading, just satisfying my curiosity -- because you can hardly mention anything I'm not curious about. I don't think anybody ever got more out of going to prison than I did. In fact, prison enabled me to study far more intensively than I would have if my life had gone differently and I had attended some college. I imagine that one of the biggest troubles with colleges is there are too many distractions, too much panty-raiding, fraternities, and boola-boola and all of that. Where else but in a prison could I have attacked my ignorance by being able to study intensely sometimes as much as fifteen hours a day?

Schopenhauer, Kant, Nietzsche, naturally, I read all of those. I don't respect them; I am just trying to remember some of those whose theories I soaked up in those years. These three, it's said, laid the groundwork on which the Fascist and Nazi philosophy was built. I don't respect them because it seems to me that most of their time was spent arguing about things that are not really important. They remind me of so many of the Negro ""intellectuals,"" so-called, with whom I have come in contact -- they are always arguing about something useless.

Spinoza impressed me for a while when I found out that he was black. A black Spanish Jew. The Jews excommunicated him because he advocated a pantheistic doctrine, something like the ""allness of God,"" or ""God in everything."" The Jews read their burial services for Spinoza, meaning that he was dead as far as they were concerned; his family was run out of Spain, they ended up in Holland, I think.

I'll tell you something. The whole stream of Western philosophy has now wound up in a cul-de-sac. The white man has perpetrated upon himself, as well as upon the black man, so gigantic a fraud that he has put himself into a crack. He did it through his elaborate, neurotic necessity to hide the black man's true role in history.

And today the white man is faced head on with what is happening on the Black Continent, Africa. Look at the artifacts being discovered there, that are proving over and over again, how the black man had great, fine, sensitive civilizations before the white man was out of the caves. Below the Sahara, in the places where most of America's Negroes' foreparents were kidnapped, there is being unearthed some of the finest craftsmanship, sculpture and other objects, that has ever been seen by modern man. Some of these things now are on view in such places as New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art. Gold work of such fine tolerance and workmanship that it has no rival. Ancient objects produced by black hands . . . refined by those black hands with results that no human hand today can equal.

History has been so ""whitened"" by the white man that even the black professors have known little more than the most ignorant black man about the talents and rich civilizations and cultures of the black man of millenniums ago. I have lectured in Negro colleges and some of these brainwashed black Ph.D.'s, with their suspenders dragging the ground with degrees, have run to the white man's newspapers calling me a ""black fanatic."" Why, a lot of them are fifty years behind the times. If I were president of one of these black colleges, I'd hock the campus if I had to, to send a bunch of black students off digging in Africa for more, more and more proof of the black race's historical greatness. The white man now is in Africa digging and searching. An African elephant can't stumble without falling on some white man with a shovel. Practically every week, we read about some great new find from Africa's lost civilizations. All that's new is white science's attitude. The ancient civilizations of the black man have been buried on the Black Continent all the time.

Here is an example: a British anthropologist named Dr. Louise S. B. Leakey is displaying some fossil bones -- a foot, part of a hand, some jaws, and skull fragments. On the basis of these, Dr. Leakey has said it's time to rewrite completely the history of man's origin.

This species of man lived 1,818,036 years before Christ. And these bones were found in Tanganyika. In the Black Continent.

It's a crime, the lie that has been told to generations of black men and white men both. Little innocent black children, born of parents who believed that their race had no history. Little black children seeing, before they could talk, that their parents considered themselves inferior. Innocent black children growing up, living out their lives, dying of old age -- and all of their lives ashamed of being black. But the truth is pouring out of the bag now.

Two other areas of experience which have been extremely formative in my life since prison were first opened to me in the Norfolk Prison Colony. For one thing, I had my first experiences in opening the eyes of my brainwashed black brethren to some truths about the black race. And, the other: when I had read enough to know something, I began to enter the Prison Colony's weekly debating program -- my baptism into public speaking.

I have to admit a sad, shameful fact. I had so loved being around the white man that in prison I really disliked how Negro convicts stuck together so much. But when Mr. Muhammad's teachings reversed my attitude toward my black brothers, in my guilt and shame I began to catch every chance I could to recruit for Mr. Muhammad.

You have to be careful, very careful, introducing the truth to the black man who has never previously heard the truth about himself, his own kind, and the white man. My brother Reginald had told me that all Muslims experienced this in their recruiting for Mr. Muhammad. The black brother is so brainwashed that he may even be repelled when he first hears the truth. Reginald advised that the truth had to be dropped only a little bit at a time. And you had to wait a while to let it sink in before advancing the next step.

I began first telling my black brother inmates about the glorious history of the black man -- things they never had dreamed. I told them the horrible slavery-trade truths that they never knew. I would watch their faces when I told them about that, because the white man had completely erased the slaves' past, a Negro in America can never know his true family name, or even what tribe he was descended from: the Mandingo, the Wolof, the Serer, the Fula, the Fanti, the Ashanti, or others. I told them that some slaves brought from Africa spoke Arabic, and were Islamic in their religion. A lot of these black convicts still wouldn't believe it unless they could see that a white man had said it. So, often, I would read to these brothers selected passages from white men's books. I'd explain to them that the real truth was known to some white men, the scholars; but there had been a conspiracy down through the generations to keep the truth from black men.

I would keep close watch on how each one reacted. I always had to be careful. I never knew when some brainwashed black imp, some dyed-in-the-wool Uncle Tom, would nod at me and then go running to tell the white man. When one was ripe -- and I could tell -- then away from the rest, I'd drop it on him, what Mr. Muhammad taught: ""The white man is the devil.""

That would shock many of them -- until they started thinking about it.

This is probably as big a single worry as the American prison system has today -- the way the Muslim teachings, circulated among all Negroes in the country, are converting new Muslims among black men in prison, and black men are in prison in far greater numbers than their proportion in the population.

The reason is that among all Negroes the black convict is the most perfectly preconditioned to hear the words, ""the white man is the devil.""

You tell that to any Negro. Except for those relatively few ""integration""-mad so-called ""intellectuals,"" and those black men who are otherwise fat, happy, and deaf, dumb, and blinded, with their crumbs from the white man's rich table, you have struck a nerve center in the American black man. He may take a day to react, a month, a year; he may never respond, openly; but of one thing you can be sure -- when he thinks about his own life, he is going to see where, to him, personally, the white man sure has acted like a devil.

And, as I say, above all Negroes, the black prisoner. Here is a black man caged behind bars, probably for years, put there by the white man. Usually the convict comes from among those bottom-of-the-pile Negroes, the Negroes who through their entire lives have been kicked about, treated like children -- Negroes who never have met one white man who didn't either take something from them or do something to them.

You let this caged-up black man start thinking, the same way I did when I first heard Elijah Muhammad's teachings: let him start thinking how, with better breaks when he was young and ambitious he might have been a lawyer, a doctor, a scientist, anything. You let this caged-up black man start realizing, as I did, how from the first landing of the first slave ship, the millions of black men in America have been like sheep in a den of wolves. That's why black prisoners become Muslims so fast when Elijah Muhammad's teachings filter into their cages by way of other Muslim convicts. ""The white man is the devil"" is a perfect echo of that black convict's lifelong experience.

I've told how debating was a weekly event there at the Norfolk Prison Colony. My reading had my mind like steam under pressure. Some way, I had to start telling the white man about himself to his face. I decided I could do this by putting my name down to debate.

Standing up and speaking before an audience was a thing that throughout my previous life never would have crossed my mind. Out there in the streets, hustling, pushing dope, and robbing, I could have had the dreams from a pound of hashish and I'd never have dreamed anything so wild as that one day I would speak in coliseums and arenas, at the greatest American universities, and on radio and television programs, not to mention speaking all over Egypt and Africa and in England.

But I will tell you that, right there, in the prison, debating, speaking to a crowd, was as exhilarating to me as the discovery of knowledge through reading had been. Standing up there, the faces looking up at me, things in my head coming out of my mouth, while my brain searched for the next best thing to follow what I was saying, and if I could sway them to my side by handling it right, then I had won the debate -- once my feet got wet, I was gone on debating. Whichever side of the selected subject was assigned to me, I'd track down and study everything I could find on it. I'd put myself in my opponent's place and decide how I'd try to win if I had the other side; and then I'd figure a way to knock down those points. And if there was any way in the world, I'd work into my speech the devilishness of the white man.

""Compulsory Military Training -- Or None?"" That's one good chance I got unexpectedly, I remember. My opponent flailed the air about the Ethiopians throwing rocks and spears at Italian airplanes, ""proving"" that compulsory military training was needed. I said the Ethiopians' black flesh had been spattered against trees by bombs the Pope in Rome had blessed, and the Ethiopians would have thrown even their bare bodies at the airplanes because they had seen that they were fighting the devil incarnate.

They yelled ""foul,"" that I'd made the subject a race issue. I said it wasn't race, it was a historical fact, that they ought to go and read Pierre van Paassen's Days of Our Years, and something not surprising to me, that book, right after the debate, disappeared from the prison library. It was right there in prison that I made up my mind to devote the rest of my life to telling the white man about himself -- or die. In a debate about whether or not Homer had ever existed, I threw into those white faces the theory that Homer only symbolized how white Europeans kidnapped black Africans, then blinded them so that they could never get back to their own people. (Homer and Omar and Moor, you see, are related terms; it's like saying Peter, Pedro, and petra, all three of which mean rock.) These blinded Moors the Europeans taught to sing about the Europeans' glorious accomplishments. I made it clear that was the devilish white man's idea of kicks. Aesop's Fables -- another case in point. ""Aesop"" was only the Greek name for an Ethiopian.

Another hot debate I remember I was in had to do with the identity of Shakespeare. No color was involved there; I just got intrigued over the Shakespearean dilemma. The King James translation of the Bible is considered the greatest piece of literature in English. Its language supposedly represents the ultimate in using the King's English. Well, Shakespeare's language and the Bible's language are one and the same. They say that from 1604 to 1611, King James got poets to translate, to write the Bible. Well, if Shakespeare existed, he was then the top poet around. But Shakespeare is nowhere reported connected with the Bible. If he existed, why didn't King James use him? And if he did use him, why is it one of the world's best kept secrets?

I know that many say that Francis Bacon was Shakespeare. If that is true, why would Bacon have kept it secret? Bacon wasn't royalty, when royalty sometimes used the nom de plume because it was ""improper"" for royalty to be artistic or theatrical. What would Bacon have had to lose? Bacon, in fact, would have had everything to gain.

In the prison debates I argued for the theory that King James himself was the real poet who used the nom de plume Shakespeare. King James was brilliant. He was the greatest king who ever sat on the British throne. Who else among royalty, in his time, would have had the giant talent to write Shakespeare's works? It was he who poetically ""fixed"" the Bible -- which in itself and its present King James version has enslaved the world.

When my brother Reginald visited, I would talk to him about new evidence I found to document the Muslim teachings. In either volume 43 or 44 of The Harvard Classics, I read Milton's Paradise Lost. The devil, kicked out of Paradise, was trying to regain possession. He was using the forces of Europe, personified by the Popes, Charlemagne, Richard the Lionhearted, and other knights. I interpreted this to show that the Europeans were motivated and led by the devil, or the personification of the devil. So Milton and Mr. Elijah Muhammad were actually saying the same thing.

I couldn't believe it when Reginald began to speak ill of Elijah Muhammad. I can't specify the exact things he said. They were more in the nature of implications against Mr. Muhammad -- the pitch of Reginald's voice, or the way that Reginald looked, rather than what he said.

It caught me totally unprepared. It threw me into a state of confusion. My blood brother, Reginald, in whom I had so much confidence, for whom I had so much respect, the one who had introduced me to the Nation of Islam. I couldn't believe it! And now Islam meant more to me than anything I ever had known in my life. Islam and Mr. Elijah Muhammad had changed my whole world.

Reginald, I learned, had been suspended from the Nation of Islam by Elijah Muhammad. He had not practiced moral restraint. After he had learned the truth, and had accepted the truth, and the Muslim laws, Reginald was still carrying on improper relations with the then secretary of the New York Temple. Some other Muslim who learned of it had made charges against Reginald to Mr. Muhammad in Chicago, and Mr. Muhammad had suspended Reginald.

When Reginald left, I was in torment. That night, finally, I wrote to Mr. Muhammad, trying to defend my brother, appealing for him. I told him what Reginald was to me, what my brother meant to me.

I put the letter into the box for the prison censor. Then all the rest of that night, I prayed to Allah. I don't think anyone ever prayed more sincerely to Allah. I prayed for some kind of relief from my confusion.

It was the next night, as I lay on my bed, I suddenly, with a start, became aware of a man sitting beside me in my chair. He had on a dark suit. I remember. I could see him as plainly as I see anyone I look at. He wasn't black, and he wasn't white. He was light-brown-skinned, an Asiatic cast of countenance, and he had oily black hair.

I looked right into his face.

I didn't get frightened. I knew I wasn't dreaming. I couldn't move, I didn't speak, and he didn't. I couldn't place him racially -- other than that I knew he was a non-European. I had no idea whatsoever who he was. He just sat there. Then, suddenly as he had come, he was gone.

Soon, Mr. Muhammad sent me a reply about Reginald. He wrote, ""If you once believed in the truth, and now you are beginning to doubt the truth, you didn't believe the truth in the first place. What could make you doubt the truth other than your own weak self?""

That struck me. Reginald was not leading the disciplined life of a Muslim. And I knew that Elijah Muhammad was right, and my blood brother was wrong. Because right is right, and wrong is wrong. Little did I then realize the day would come when Elijah Muhammad would be accused by his own sons as being guilty of the same acts of immorality that he judged Reginald and so many others for.

But at that time, all of the doubt and confusion in my mind was removed. All of the influence that my brother had wielded over me was broken. From that day on, as far as I am concerned, everything that my brother Reginald has done is wrong.

But Reginald kept visiting me. When he had been a Muslim, he had been immaculate in his attire. But now, he wore things like a T-shirt, shabby-looking trousers, and sneakers. I could see him on the way down. When he spoke, I heard him coldly. But I would listen. He was my blood brother.

Gradually, I saw the chastisement of Allah -- what Christians would call ""the curse"" -- come upon Reginald. Elijah Muhammad said that Allah was chastising Reginald -- and that anyone who challenged Elijah Muhammad would be chastened by Allah. In Islam we were taught that as long as one didn't know the truth, he lived in darkness. But once the truth was accepted, and recognized, he lived in light, and whoever would then go against it would be punished by Allah.

Mr. Muhammad taught that the five-pointed star stands for justice, and also for the five senses of man. We were taught that Allah executes justice by working upon the five senses of those who rebel against His Messenger, or against His truth. We were taught that this was Allah's way of letting Muslims know His sufficiency to defend His Messenger against any and all opposition, as long as the Messenger himself didn't deviate from the path of truth. We were taught that Allah turned the minds of any defectors into a turmoil. I thought truly that it was Allah doing this to my brother.

One letter, I think from my brother Philbert, told me that Reginald was with them in Detroit. I heard no more about Reginald until one day, weeks later, Ella visited me; she told me that Reginald was at her home in Roxbury, sleeping. Ella said she had heard a knock, she had gone to the door, and there was Reginald, looking terrible. Ella said she had asked, ""Where did you come from?"" And Reginald had told her he came from Detroit. She said she asked him, ""How did you get here?"" And he had told her, ""I walked.""

I believed he had walked. I believed in Elijah Muhammad, and he had convinced us that Allah's chastisement upon Reginald's mind had taken away Reginald's ability to gauge distance and time. There is a dimension of time with which we are not familiar here in the West. Elijah Muhammad said that under Allah's chastisement, the five senses of a man can be so deranged by those whose mental powers are greater than his that in five minutes his hair can turn snow white. Or he will walk nine hundred miles as he might walk five blocks.

In prison, since I had become a Muslim, I had grown a beard. When Reginald visited me, he nervously moved about in his chair; he told me that each hair on my beard was a snake. Everywhere, he saw snakes.

He next began to believe that he was the ""Messenger of Allah."" Reginald went around in the streets of Roxbury, Ella reported to me, telling people that he had some divine power. He graduated from this to saying that he was Allah.

He finally began saying he was greater than Allah.

Authorities picked up Reginald, and he was put into an institution. They couldn't find what was wrong. They had no way to understand Allah's chastisement. Reginald was released. Then he was picked up again, and was put into another institution.

Reginald is in an institution now. I know where, but I won't say. I would not want to cause him any more trouble than he has already had.

I believe, today, that it was written, it was meant, for Reginald to be used for one purpose only: as a bait, as a minnow to reach into the ocean of blackness where I was, to save me.

I cannot understand it any other way.

After Elijah Muhammad himself was later accused as a very immoral man, I came to believe that it wasn't a divine chastisement upon Reginald, but the pain he felt when his own family totally rejected him for Elijah Muhammad, and this hurt made Reginald turn insanely upon Elijah Muhammad.

It's impossible to dream, or to see, or to have a vision of someone whom you never have seen before -- and to see him exactly as he is. To see someone, and to see him exactly as he looks, is to have a pre-vision.

I would later come to believe that my pre-vision was of Master W. D. Fard, the Messiah, the one whom Elijah Muhammad said had appointed him -- Elijah Muhammad -- as His Last Messenger to the black people of North America.

My last year in prison was spent back in the Charlestown Prison. Even among the white inmates, the word had filtered around. Some of those brainwashed black convicts talked too much. And I know that the censors had reported on my mail. The Norfolk Prison Colony officials had become upset. They used as a reason for my transfer that I refused to take some kind of shots, an inoculation or something.

The only thing that worried me was that I hadn't much time left before I would be eligible for parole-board consideration. But I reasoned that they might look at my representing and spreading Islam in another way: instead of keeping me in they might want to get me out.

I had come to prison with 20/20 vision. But when I got sent back to Charlestown, I had read so much by the lights-out glow in my room at the Norfolk Prison Colony that I had astigmatism and the first pair of the eyeglasses that I have worn ever since.

I had less maneuverability back in the much stricter Charlestown Prison. But I found that a lot of Negroes attended a Bible class, and I went there.

Conducting the class was a tall, blond, blue-eyed (a perfect ""devil"") Harvard Seminary student. He lectured, and then he started in a question-and-answer session. I don't know which of us had read the Bible more, he or I, but I had to give him credit; he really was heavy on his religion. I puzzled and puzzled for a way to upset him, and to give those Negroes present something to think and talk about and circulate.

Finally, I put up my hand; he nodded. He had talked about Paul.

I stood up and asked, ""What color was Paul?"" And I kept talking, with pauses, ""He had to be black . . . because he was a Hebrew . . . and the original Hebrews were black . . . weren't they?""

He had started flushing red. You know the way white people do. He said ""Yes.""

I wasn't through yet. ""What color was Jesus . . . he was Hebrew, too . . . wasn't he?""

Both the Negro and the white convicts had sat bolt upright. I don't care how tough the convict, be he brainwashed black Christian, or a ""devil"" white Christian, neither of them is ready to hear anybody saying Jesus wasn't white. The instructor walked around. He shouldn't have felt bad. In BALLS!!!! all of the years since, I never have met any intelligent white man who would try to insist that Jesus was white. How could they? He said, ""Jesus was brown.""

I let him get away with that compromise.

Exactly as I had known it would, almost overnight the Charlestown convicts, black and white, began buzzing with the story. Wherever I went, I could feel the nodding. And anytime I got a chance to exchange words with a black brother in stripes, I'd say, ""My man! You ever heard about somebody named Mr. Elijah Muhammad?""Embed"

The way I stepped in there with the SK Air, fam' serious tekkers
Brand new vest, same old leathers
She knows we are the real Goodfellas
We can be cool, yeah we can ride out
Please just don't get jealous
Start textin' me crazy, I gotta take desperate measures
[Pre-Chorus]
I just came back from Mars in my new spaceship
It was a perfect landing
What you mean, ""what you mean""? I'm a king she's a queen
Man you know what's happenin' (Ice)
Nowadays they call me ginger bread man 'cah they just can't catch him
All the ladies love man, I love them too, we got an understanding

[Chorus]
Pure water and lots of ice, she knows that I be the boss of life
Pure water and lots of ice, she knows that I be the boss of life
Pure water and lots of ice, she knows that I be the boss of life

To fall in love
With the things you do
Don't sell yourself
To fall in love
With those things you do

[Verse 1: Baatin]
Ladies loving my music is like some sex shit
Niggas trying to grip up my mic like it's a dick
Run around the corner to pick up the new shit
Toss this in the deck so niggas can catch rep
I'm the motherfucker gripping the mic like it's a joke
Niggas fall in love with the music like it's a ho
Put down your mic, you lost your whole flow
You take it too seriously like it's a gamble
Fuck this rap shit, I listen to classical
In the studio loop as usual
Loving my lyrical, fuck bitches that you would know
I'm out of this 'cause you wanna be below
Y'all niggas in love with the S
Y'all niggas in love with the essence

All the way to New Orleans where the girls cook catfish
And in L.A., every chick's an actress

To Detroit, yeah the place that I rest
Where the ladies got ass and symbolize sex
And hot Atlanta, y'all is one of the best
Where they speak Southern slang and smoke la cess
And New York, women are way too fresh
Too much on your mind, let me ease that stress
I wish you all were mine, it's so selfish
Maybe I'm feeling myself too much, I guess
But, to my ladies all across the globe
In small towns that I don't even know
To all local international codes

Had a Beverly Hills mami that would buy me Cartis
Take me to afterparties, her name was Khari
And it sucks that we didn't keep in touch, I'm sorry

Why they take lil' bro instead of me?

Niggas was seventeen, when I found out what that cheddar mean
Rats'll bite holes through the wall to get close
Watch for their trail, man they always be close
I'm a Back-a-wood roller, really a smoker
This louder than when you drive on the shoulder
Stomp on the gas 'til I'm blowin' the motor
Can't 'ford to sit with my thoughts or it's over

Ay, krash kourse into the world, this insular world
The culture vultures flock in every sense of the word
My nose can sniff the shit out but I'm never deterred
Never be scurred, scored through the downs, first and third
Grandaddy spittin, ain't nothing new bout the system
'Cause how they do me they did him
Appropriating the fellas, sucking the fruit from my elders
Don't give a Chuck bout no Berry, they rather listen to Elvis
Woah, mama, and these kids know better, uh
I'm grand like abuela, uh, more hands than Coachella, uh
Lil hoe it's whatever, uh
Shawty cold as December, I still fold her, no Manila
B-b-b-bear wit me, baby, I hibernate, smoke the lettuce

Yeah, used to dream about the coupe, baby
Now I think of me and you

I don't know what's better, I won't say what's worse
Pen is like a needle when I bleed these words
I could make a blessing if I spit this verse
That's why I be retching 'til I rid my curse
Black it be the sweetest, secrecy up in the frequencies
That's why you feel the need to look at me like I'm a deity
Duality is key, you see, that I'm seein' you seein' me
So now we seeing equally, and that don't happen easily
Needlessly to say, I hate that we're meeting this way
Feel like I packed up to go 'bout a week ago, I don't know
If I switch up my flow I might tap into the pinnacles
I'm sellin' syllables, I'm losing principles
Lurkin', searching for miracles, hurtin' workmen, curtain closed
Earn a million dollars just to owe it to some imbeciles
If they tell me no, I be dumb, all I hear is go
Crossfire coming but I'm pigeon-toed, winter froze

[Chorus: Bari]
I done went Murda Mike, on the may-a-ooo, uh
She on the payroll, he on the payroll

[Bridge: Smino]
Cunning linguistics, punishing puns
Pumping the petrol, gas in my lungs
Loving the low times, higher than a mug
Up in the cabinet
Imagine a baby reaching his hands up to grab it
A pipe done busted in heaven
And got to leaking out blessings
Reaching my hands up to grab it
Re'in my bands up, uh, uh

[Verse 3: Noname]
Sunny metropolis, overzealous as telefone
Telefone a new continent, maybe rode me a rocketship
Copper all on my dash, and he ticket that lady optimist
Said I'm moving too fast, slow down, slow down
Opened up for Lauryn Hill, woah now, woah now, woah now
Everything is everything and the object steady mystified
My allegories underneath the rock will only fear resides
I bet I'm gon' find it, I know I'm gon' find it
Happiness, bank account, white accountant, I found the fountain
I was born in all black, how could God denounce this?
I told Him, 'Give me my money, I need my money now'
Thank you Jesus, whoever you are
I know you gifted me the gift of gab and simile
And simpleness, the solitude is loneliness, been good to me
I told them, 'Give me my happy, I need my holy now'

Here's a 40 — swig it! You know it's frigid
I got 'em chillin' in the cooler, break out the ruler
Damn! That's the fattest stoge I ever seen
The weather's keen in Cali
Gettin' weeded makes it feel like Maui
Now we feel the good vibrations
So many females, so much inspiration

[Verse 2: A-Plus]
I get inspired by the blunts too! (Too)
I'll front you (You), if you hang with a bunk crew (Chump)
I roam the strip for bones to pick

Yo, crews are jealous 'cause we get props
The cops wanna stop our fun, but the top

Under their noses, this bro's quick
To hit blunts and flip once I'm chillin' 'cause my crew's close, kid

I'm posted, most kids accept this as cool
I exit, 'cause I'm an exception to the rule (Hell no, I'm out)
I'm steppin' to the cool spots where crews flock
(Yo what's up, how you doin'?)
To snare a dip, or see where the shit that's flam-bee

Time to get prolific with the whiz, kid

Holdin' stunts captive with my persona

Flipped! The flyer attire females desire
Baby, you can step to this if you admire
The exxx-traordinary dapper rapper
Keep tabs on your main squeeze before I tap her

[Verse 12: A-Plus]
I mack her, attack her with the smoothness
I do this, peepin' what my crew gets, huh! (Shit)
Loot, props, respect and blunts to pass
Crews talk shit, but in my face, they kiss my ass (Smack!)
They bite flows, but we make up new ones
If you're really dope, why ain't you signed yet?

La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

[Verse 1]
For you, there might be a brighter star
But through my eyes, the light of you is all I see
For you, there might be another song
But all my heart can hear is your melody

[Chorus]
So long ago, my heart, without demanding
Informed me that no other love could do
But listen did I not, though understanding
Fell in love with one who would break my heart in two

[Verse 2]
For you, love might bring a toast of wine
But with each sparkle, know the best for you, I pray
Woah, for you, love might be for you to find
But I will celebrate our love of yesterday

[Chorus]
So long ago, my heart, without demanding
Informed me that no other love could do
But listen did I not, though understanding
I fell in love with one who would break my heart in two, woah, woah
You might also like[Verse 3]
Woah, for you, there might be another star
But through my eyes, the light of you is all I see
Woah, for you, there might be another song
But in my heart, your melody will stay with me, oh

Stromae,Fils de joie,"41 ContributorsTranslationsEnglishEspañolItalianoFils de joie Lyrics[Paroles de ""Fils de joie""]

[Couplet 1]
Être seul, c'est difficile et, là, ça fait des années
Et, de juger, c'est facile, surtout quand on n'y a pas goûté
Le plus dur, bah, c'était la première fois
Puis, le plus dur, c'est de savoir quand s'ra la dernière fois, hmm
C'est vrai, j'suis pas contre un peu d'tendresse de temps en temps
Et puis, cette fois ci, bah, j'pourrais l'faire en l'insultant
Oui, tout est négociable dans la vie, moyennant paiement
En plus, j'suis sûrement son meilleur client

[Refrain]
Mais oh, laissez donc ma maman
Oui, je sais, c'est vrai qu'elle n'est pas parfaite
C'est un héros et ce s'ra toujours fièrement
Que j'en parlerai, que j'en parlerai
J'suis un fils de pute, comme ils disent, après tout c'qu'elle a fait pour eux
Pardonne leurs bêtises, ô, chère mère
Ils te déshumanisent, c'est plus facile
Les mêmes te courtisent et tout l'monde ferme les yeux

[Couplet 2]
Pourquoi tout l'monde me déteste alors qu'c'est moi qui les nourris ?
Leurs vies s'raient bien plus modestes, sans moi, elles seraient pourries
Le lit et la sécurité ont un prix, madame
Bah oui, dans la vie, tout s'paye, on n'te l'avait donc jamais appris ? Hmm
On m'accuse de faire de la traite d'êtres humains
Mais cinquante, quarante, trente ou vingt pour cent, c'est déjà bien
Faudrait pas qu'elles se prennent un peu trop pour des mannequins
Mesdames, ou devrais-je dire ""putains""

[Couplet 3]
Je sais qu'c'est ton boulot, mais faut bien qu'j'fasse le mien, non ?
Entre l'tien et le mien, la différence, c'est que, moi, je paye des impôts
Allez, circulez, madame, reprends tes papiers et c'qu'il t'reste de dignité
Pauvre femme, pff, trouve-toi un vrai métier

[Pont]
Mais oh (Mais oh), laissez donc ma maman
Oui, je sais (Oui, je sais), c'est vrai qu'elle n'est pas parfaite

Oh bébé - oups ! - mademoiselle
J'vais pas vous draguer, promis juré
J'suis célibataire, depuis hier putain !
J'peux pas faire d'enfant et bon c'est pas - Eh reviens !
Cinq minutes quoi ! J't'ai pas insultée

[Couplet 1]
J'suis pas tout seul à être tout seul
Ça fait d'jà ça d'moins dans la tête
Et si j'comptais combien on est
Beaucoup
Tout ce à quoi j'ai d'jà pensé
Dire que plein d'autres y ont d'jà pensé
Mais, malgré tout, je m'sens tout seul
Du coup

[Refrain]
J'ai parfois eu des pensées suicidaires, et j'en suis peu fier
On croit parfois que c'est la seule manière de les faire taire
Ces pensées qui me font vivre un enfer
Ces pensées qui me font vivre un enfer

[Couplet 2]
Est-c'qu'y a que moi qui ai la télé
Et la chaîne culpabilité ?
Mais faut bien s'changer les idées
Pas trop quand même
Sinon ça r'part vite dans la tête
Et c'est trop tard pour qu'ça s'arrête
C'est là qu'j'aimerais tout oublier

Quand même dehors, le temps est gris
Et, d'ailleurs, dedans aussi, y a les jours sans, les jours avec
Ce sera sans, j'te l'parie
Y a mon caca qui a mal fini

Yeah, Hi-Tek, watch me!
For whom do we aspire to reflect our own people's death
For whose entertainment shall we sing our agony?
In what hopes?
That the destroyers aspiring to extinguish us will suddenly
Suffer remorse at the sight of their own fantastic success?
The last imbecile to dream such a dream is dead
He was killed by the saviors of his own dream
Armah, 2000 seasons

[Verse 1]
I'm not a human being gettin' on some spiritual shit
A spiritual being manifested as a human, that's it
When I spit, I spray thoughts that's representin' my life
Yo, I step into the spot, leave niggas open like mics
Take 'em on a tour, explore psychologies of war
Things you can't imagine if you've never seen 'em before
Shorties come back raw straight after C-74
I welcome them back to the world they think is run by law
The world is run by men who use laws for tools
But I come through, war tactics like Shaka Zulu
MC's is soft like Play-Doh — I shape 'em, smash 'em to pieces
Volunteer slaves crave the words I'm paintin' — the masterpieces
You hear 'em on the radio babblin', but the truth is travelin'
With the word I sent flyin' through the air like a javelin
Unravelin' like a verdict, pound it in your chest like a gavel in
The highest court in Babylon, let's travel on
If the world is foul, and you think foul is how you got to live
Then from the get, your ass was foul, and foul just is how you is
No excuses, see, life's dilemmas are set up like a mirror
Just to show you all your faces
Now your understanding is clearer
You had your chance for evolution, you let it pass you by
That's why I'm dissin' wack MC's until the day that I die
Reflection gettin' you high
We stand our ground with the believers
The Leaning Tower of Pisa and the Pyramids of Giza
No comparison!
The way I flip it is embarrassin'
'Tis the season, ain't no carolin'

Yo, it's right in front of yo' grill! Stop lookin' everywhere else
Speakin' of plannin'

Took up too much time
You like a fiend for rocks that got cooked up

I got my team's, so the fiends now become opponents
They the opposition, stronger from competition
Shinin' like a golden shower, your face I'm pissin' in
Completin' a genocide mission like The Warren commission

While our sisters was supposed to be whorin'
Save it for a rainy day, money is pourin'

[Chorus: That Mexican OT]

Hundred-round drum, I don't miss shit
Hit his ass up, have his mama throw a bitch fit
Say he want smoke, push up, you can hit this
Boss-ass Mexican, I got me a rich bitch
Slide down his block, I'ma knock off his top
I'ma reload the Glock, scratch his name off the hitlist

[Verse 1: That Mexican OT]
I'm that Mexican that they wanna be
Nah, fuck that, I'm the Mexican that they wanna see

Bitch, I stay after F, I'm a motherfuckin' G

Anybody that said they got a problеm, I'll knock out his teeth
Put a big X on his head if he a plug

Wе gon' push up with yoppers and choppers and yeah, we gon' pop 'em

Blow 'em back with the big MAC, fold 'em like a pretzel

In my hood, I'm connected and good like a stop sign

Called down the stairs of your mother's house
Sydney’s sittin' on the couch

I don’t even care
If you were making out
I guess you worked it out
Worked it out
Yeah

[Chorus]
And then it started to snow
I didn't think about it when I gave you my coat
I didn't think about it when I wrote you that note
I guess there're some things that you shouldn't know
But I'll tell you anyway
And you can tell me 'bout it if you've had a bad day
I’ll teach you how to laugh if you can teach me crochet
Why go to class if we’re already late

Waiting around for something to change my mood
'Cause I know that what's in this plastic cup isn't going to
Kids on the lawn, stuck in pairs of two
Your lunch is on its way back up but you're still in the pool

Wait inside
I'll be fine
I guess I'll sit outside
While you change your mind, oh no, woah-oh

[Verse 2]
I'll risk it all to find
A place where I can hear my thoughts
This song is playing too loud
But upstairs they're still making out
I'm getting all choked up
I guess it's just my luck
And I'm stuck on the porch
What am I waiting for?

Been working for the man
Every God damn day
I've been smoking with my friends
To wash the nights away
Catching up on sleep's
Harder when I'm waking up next to me

[Verse 2]
There's a girl from down the road
Sendin looks my way
Frankly dear I'm not quite sure
What I'm supposed to say
How can I say no?
When you're a thousand miles away

[Chorus]
Wish I could roll the windows down
But the snow has swallowed up our little town

[Verse 3]
Well there's coffee in my cup & cameras in my face
Well I think I've had enough
Of all these people in this place
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Could be a thousand miles away

If you, if you could return
Don't let it burn, don't let it fade
I'm sure I'm not being rude
But it's just your attitude
It's tearing me apart
It's ruining everything
And I swore, I swore I would be true
And honey, so did you
So why were you holding her hand?
Is that the way we stand?
Were you lying all the time?
Was it just a game to you?

[Chorus]
But I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?

[Verse 2]
Oh, I thought the world of you
I thought nothing could go wrong
But I was wrong, I was wrong
If you, if you could get by
Trying not to lie
Things wouldn't be so confused
And I wouldn't feel so used

I just want to be with you

Did I not show you a way out?
Beneath the veil you saw my vision wrapped in doubt
You’re not my son and not my muse
As you remind me, though I never thought this through

[Chorus]
Vices squeeze us till we’re blue, me and you

Fear of going back to find
All the nothingness we left behind

Superstition is a hoax
Though we both cannot seem to practice what we know
Stepping over every crack
Waiting for sweet life to break our bloodied backs

The Pharcyde,Passin' Me By,"121 ContributorsPassin’ Me By Lyrics[Produced by J-Swift]
[Verse 1: Bootie Brown]
Now in my younger days, I used to sport a shag
When I went to school, I carried lunch in a bag
With a apple for my teacher 'cause I knew I'd get a kiss
Always got mad when the class was dismissed
But when it was in session, I always had a question
I would raise my hand to make her stand, come to my desk and
Help me with my problem, it was never much
Just a trick to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch
Oh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug
She was married to the man, he was a thug
His name was Lee, he drove a Z
He'd pick her up from school promptly at three o'clock
I was on her jock, yes indeedy, I wrote graffiti on the bus
First I'd write her name, then carve a plus
With my name last, on the looking glass
I seen her yesterday, but still, I had to let her pass
[Chorus: Fatlip]
She keeps on passin' me by
She keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on pass—

When I dream of fairytales, I think of me and Shelly
See, she's my type of hype and I can't stand when brothers tell me
That I should quit chasin' and look for something better
But the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter
I haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her
I just play it by ear and hope she gets the picture
I'm shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger
She could be my broad and I could be her nigga, but
All I could do was stare
Back as kids we used to kiss when we played truth or dare
Now she's more sophisticated, highly edu-ma-cated
Not at all overrated, I think I need a prayer
To get in her book and it looks rather dry
I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye
Although she's crazy stepping, I'll try and stop her stride
'Cause I won't have no more of this passin' me by

[Verse 3: Imani]
Time for me to voice my opinion, can't be pretending she didn't have me
Sprung like a chicken, chasing my tail like a doggie
She was kind of like a star, thinking I was like a fan
Damn, she looked good, downside, she had a man
He was a rooty-toot, a nincompoop
She told me, ""Soon your little birdie's gonna fly the coop""
She was a flake like corn and I was born not to understand
By letting her pass, I proved to be a better man
[Chorus: Fatlip]
She keeps on passin' me by (Passing me by)
She keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passin' me—

[Verse 4: Fatlip]
Now there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian
And now the world around me begins moving in slow motion when-
Ever she happens to walk by, why does the apple of my eye
Overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try?
Wait, no, I did not really pursue my little princess with persistence
And I was so low-key that she was unaware of my existence
From a distance I desired her, secretly admired her
Wired her a letter to get her, and it went
""My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me, but I know you
Very well, now let me tell you 'bout the feelings I have for you
When I try or make some sort of attempt, I simp
Damn, I wish I wasn't such a wimp
'Cause then I would let you know that I love you so and if I was your man, then I would be true
The only lying I would do is in the bed with you""
Then I signed ""Sincerely, the one who loves you dearly, P.S. Love Me Tender""
The letter came back three days later ""Return to Sender"", damn
[Chorus: Fatlip]
She keeps on passin' me by
She keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on pass—
[Post-Chorus]
Nevertheless, I'll say it again (Passing me by)
Nevertheless, I'll say it again
Nevertheless—
Nevertheless—
Nevertheless, I'll say it again

She keeps passin' me by (I'll say it again)

I did it all for the money, Lord, it's what it seems
Well in the world of night terrors, it's hard to dream
They holl'in', ""Cash rules everything,"" just call it cream
'Cause when it rises to the top, you get the finer things
Ocean fronts, rolling blunts with model chickens
Saying grace over lobster and steak
Like, please forgive us for riding Benzes with camera plates
Too busy looking backwards for jackers to pump my brakes
For help signs to symbolize the lives that hunger takes
Addicted to the green; if I don't ball, I get the shakes
I'd give it all for a peace of mind, for Heaven's sakes
My heart's so heavy that the ropes that hold my casket breaks
'Cause everything that wasn't for me, I had to chase
I had to take, I had to take

Like when autumn leaves
Fall down from the trees
There goes my honeybee

[Chorus: Aaron Livingston]
I've lost a lot of sleep to dreams
And I do not miss them
Yet, I wouldn't wish them on the worst of enemies
Let them burn, go from here
Like when autumn leaves

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
To catch a thief, who stole the soul I prayed to keep
Insomniac, bad dreams got me losing sleep
I'm dead tired, my mind playing tricks, deceit
A face in the glass, unable to admit defeat
All that I am, all that I was is history
The past unraveled, adding insult to this injury
I'm fighting the battle for the soul of the century
Destiny is everything that I pretend to be
Look, and what I did came back to me eventually
The music played on, and told me I was meant to be awake
It's unresolved like everything I had at stake
Illegal activity controls my Black symphony
Orchestrated like it happened incidentally
Oh, there I go, from a man to a memory
Damn, I wonder if my fam will remember me?

Thin is the line that run between love and hatred
The game is ill-natured, it's nothin' sacred
A-yo, it's funny what I see some rap niggas do to make it
A few'll blow up, or go as far as they can take it
My nine-to-five is just to hit ya, get the party live
I'm Black Thought, used to rap for sport
Now the rhyme-sayin', rent-payin' life support
I take it very seriously within this industry
It's various crews that try to touch me
But I come with the beautiful things, and I bless the track plushly
Around the world, crowds love me from doin' tours
Recipient of applause from all of you and yours
Creator of original sounds that's in the stores
You take home to absorb, and sweat it out your pores
Now, who can stop the music runnin' through these veins?
Infinitely go against the grain, that's why my motto's to..

Never do what they do, what they do, what they do

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
Livin' the life of limos and lights
Airplanes and trains, short days and long nights
Keyboards and mics, bass chords and drum kicks
And my mental thick, they hit my head like brick
As I embark on a mission, welcomin' to the dark
When I first spark the art's when the listenin' start
Open your head wide, and let the Thought inside
My style fortified by all of Philadelph-i
My delph more stealth than all the wicked wealth-y
Mentality undetectable by the naked eye
Then I get paid when the record is played
To put it short — ""I want It Made"" like Ed, 'nuff said!
Then after that, I'm puttin' on my cousin Hamed
We let the ladies blend with the dark-skinned thoroughbred
And discover my level is that of no other
And Roots crew reign official and true while I'm continuin' to..

If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Somebody told me that this planet was small
We used to live in the same building on the same floor and never met before
Until I'm overseas on tour and peeped this Ethiopian queen from Philly takin' classes abroad
She studyin' film and photo, flash, focus, record
Said she workin' on a flick and could my clique do the score?
She said she loved my show in Paris at Élysée Montmartre
And that I stepped off the stage and took a piece of her heart
We knew from the start that things fall apart and tend to shatter
She like that shit don't matter, when I get home, get at her
Through letter, phone, whatever, let's link, let's get together
Shit, you think not? Think the Thought went home and forgot?
Time passed, we back in Philly, now she up in my spot
Tellin' me the things I'm tellin' her is makin' her hot
Started buildin' with her constantly, 'round the clock
Now she in my world like hip-hop, they keep tellin' me, tellin' me, yo

[Verse 2: Black Thought, Eve, Black Thought & Eve]
Yo, I'm the type that's always catchin' a flight (Uh-huh)
And sometimes I got to be out at the height of the night
And that's when she flip and get on some old ""Another lonely night?""
Seem like I'm on the side, you only lovin' your mic
I know you gotta get that paper, daddy, keep that shit tight
But, yo, I need some sort of love in my life, you dig me?
While politickin' with my sister from New York City
She said she know this ball player and he think I'm pretty
Psych, I'm playin', boo, you know it's just with you, I'm stayin', boo
And when cats be poppin' game, I don't hear what they sayin', boo
When you out there in the world, I'm still your girl
With all my classes, I don't have the time for life's thrills
So when you sweatin' on stage, think of me when you rhyme
And don't be listenin' to your homies, they be leadin' you blind
Yeah, so what you sayin'? I can trust you?
Is you crazy? You my king, for real
But sometimes, relationships get ill, no doubt

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
That snake could be that chick and that rat could be that cool cat
That's whisperin', ""She tryna play you for the fool, Black""
If something's on your chest, then let it be known (Right)
See, I'm not your every five minutes all on the phone
And on the topic of trust, it's just a matter of fact
That people bite backs and fracture what's intact
And there'll forever be (Right), I ain't on some, ""Oh, I'm a celebrity""
I deal with the real, so if it's artificial, let it be
I seen people caught in love like whirlwinds (Caught in love like whirlwinds)
Listenin' to they squads and listenin' to girlfriends (Right, they're listenin' to girlfriends)
That's exactly the point where they whole world ends
Lies come in, that's where the drama begins, and she like, yo

The Smiths,Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others - 2011 Remaster,"6 ContributorsMorehouse College 2013 Commencement Speech LyricsHello, Morehouse! (Applause.) Thank you, everybody. Please be seated.

I have to say that it is one of the great honors of my life to be able to address this gathering here today. I want to thank Dr. Wilson for his outstanding leadership, and the Board of Trustees. We have Congressman Cedric Richmond and Sanford Bishop — both proud alumni of this school, as well as Congressman Hank Johnson. And one of my dear friends and a great inspiration to us all — the great John Lewis is here. (Applause.) We have your outstanding Mayor, Mr. Kasim Reed, in the house. (Applause.)

To all the members of the Morehouse family. And most of all, congratulations to this distinguished group of Morehouse Men — the Class of 2013. (Applause.)

I have to say that it’s a little hard to follow — not Dr. Wilson, but a skinny guy with a funny name. (Laughter.) Betsegaw Tadele — he’s going to be doing something.

I also have to say that you all are going to get wet. (Laughter.) And I’d be out there with you if I could. (Laughter.) But Secret Service gets nervous. (Laughter.) So I’m going to have to stay here, dry. (Laughter.) But know that I’m there with you in spirit. (Laughter.)

Some of you are graduating summa cum laude. (Applause.) Some of you are graduating magna cum laude. (Applause.) I know some of you are just graduating, “thank you, Lordy.” (Laughter and applause.) That’s appropriate because it’s a Sunday. (Laughter.)

I see some moms and grandmas here, aunts, in their Sunday best — although they are upset about their hair getting messed up. (Laughter.) Michelle would not be sitting in the rain. (Laughter.) She has taught me about hair. (Laughter.)

I want to congratulate all of you — the parents, the grandparents, the brothers and sisters, the family and friends who supported these young men in so many ways. This is your day, as well. Just think about it — your sons, your brothers, your nephews — they spent the last four years far from home and close to Spelman, and yet they are still here today. (Applause.) So you’ve done something right. Graduates, give a big round of applause to your family for everything that they’ve done for you. (Applause.)

I know that some of you had to wait in long lines to get into today’s ceremony. And I would apologize, but it did not have anything to do with security. Those graduates just wanted you to know what it’s like to register for classes here. (Laughter and applause.) And this time of year brings a different kind of stress — every senior stopping by Gloster Hall over the past week making sure your name was actually on the list of students who met all the graduation requirements. (Applause.) If it wasn’t on the list, you had to figure out why. Was it that library book you lent to that trifling roommate who didn’t return it? (Laughter.) Was it Dr. Johnson’s policy class? (Applause.) Did you get enough Crown Forum credits? (Applause.)

On that last point, I’m going to exercise my power as President to declare this speech sufficient Crown Forum credits for any otherwise eligible student to graduate. That is my graduation gift to you. (Applause.) You have a special dispensation.

Now, graduates, I am humbled to stand here with all of you as an honorary Morehouse Man. (Applause.) I finally made it. (Laughter.) And as I do, I’m mindful of an old saying: “You can always tell a Morehouse Man — (applause) — but you can’t tell him much.” (Applause.) And that makes my task a little more difficult, I suppose. But I think it also reflects the sense of pride that’s always been part of this school’s tradition.

Benjamin Mays, who served as the president of Morehouse for almost 30 years, understood that tradition better than anybody. He said — and I quote — “It will not be sufficient for Morehouse College, for any college, for that matter, to produce clever graduates — but rather honest men, men who can be trusted in public and private life — men who are sensitive to the wrongs, the sufferings, and the injustices of society and who are willing to accept responsibility for correcting (those) ills.”

It was that mission — not just to educate men, but to cultivate good men, strong men, upright men — that brought community leaders together just two years after the end of the Civil War. They assembled a list of 37 men, free blacks and freed slaves, who would make up the first prospective class of what later became Morehouse College. Most of those first students had a desire to become teachers and preachers — to better themselves so they could help others do the same.
A century and a half later, times have changed. But the “Morehouse Mystique” still endures. Some of you probably came here from communities where everybody looked like you. Others may have come here in search of a community. And I suspect that some of you probably felt a little bit of culture shock the first time you came together as a class in King’s Chapel. All of a sudden, you weren’t the only high school sports captain, you weren’t the only student council president. You were suddenly in a group of high achievers, and that meant you were expected to do something more.

That’s the unique sense of purpose that this place has always infused — the conviction that this is a training ground not only for individual success, but for leadership that can change the world.

Dr. King was just 15 years old when he enrolled here at Morehouse. He was an unknown, undersized, unassuming young freshman who lived at home with his parents. And I think it’s fair to say he wasn’t the coolest kid on campus — for the suits he wore, his classmates called him “Tweed.” But his education at Morehouse helped to forge the intellect, the discipline, the compassion, the soul force that would transform America. It was here that he was introduced to the writings of Gandhi and Thoreau, and the theory of civil disobedience. It was here that professors encouraged him to look past the world as it was and fight for the world as it should be. And it was here, at Morehouse, as Dr. King later wrote, where “I realized that nobody — was afraid.”

Not even of some bad weather. I added on that part. (Laughter.) I know it’s wet out there. But Dr. Wilson told me you all had a choice and decided to do it out here anyway. (Applause.) That’s a Morehouse Man talking.

Now, think about it. For black men in the ’40s and the ’50s, the threat of violence, the constant humiliations, large and small, the uncertainty that you could support a family, the gnawing doubts born of the Jim Crow culture that told you every day that somehow you were inferior, the temptation to shrink from the world, to accept your place, to avoid risks, to be afraid — that temptation was necessarily strong.

And yet, here, under the tutelage of men like Dr. Mays, young Martin learned to be unafraid. And he, in turn, taught others to be unafraid. And over time, he taught a nation to be unafraid. And over the last 50 years, thanks to the moral force of Dr. King and a Moses generation that overcame their fear and their cynicism and their despair, barriers have come tumbling down, and new doors of opportunity have swung open, and laws and hearts and minds have been changed to the point where someone who looks just like you can somehow come to serve as President of these United States of America. (Applause.)

So the history we share should give you hope. The future we share should give you hope. You’re graduating into an improving job market. You’re living in a time when advances in technology and communication put the world at your fingertips. Your generation is uniquely poised for success unlike any generation of African Americans that came before it.

But that doesn’t mean we don’t have work — because if we’re honest with ourselves, we know that too few of our brothers have the opportunities that you’ve had here at Morehouse.

In troubled neighborhoods all across this country — many of them heavily African American — too few of our citizens have role models to guide them. Communities just a couple miles from my house in Chicago, communities just a couple miles from here — they’re places where jobs are still too scarce and wages are still too low; where schools are underfunded and violence is pervasive; where too many of our men spend their youth not behind a desk in a classroom, but hanging out on the streets or brooding behind a jail cell.

My job, as President, is to advocate for policies that generate more opportunity for everybody — policies that strengthen the middle class and give more people the chance to climb their way into the middle class. Policies that create more good jobs and reduce poverty, and educate more children, and give more families the security of health care, and protect more of our children from the horrors of gun violence. That’s my job. Those are matters of public policy, and it is important for all of us — black, white and brown — to advocate for an America where everybody has got a fair shot in life. Not just some. Not just a few. (Applause.)

But along with collective responsibilities, we have individual responsibilities. There are some things, as black men, we can only do for ourselves. There are some things, as Morehouse Men, that you are obliged to do for those still left behind. As Morehouse Men, you now wield something even more powerful than the diploma you’re about to collect — and that’s the power of your example.

So what I ask of you today is the same thing I ask of every graduating class I address: Use that power for something larger than yourself. Live up to President Mays’s challenge. Be “sensitive to the wrongs, the sufferings, and the injustices of society.” And be “willing to accept responsibility for correcting (those) ills.”

I know that some of you came to Morehouse from communities where life was about keeping your head down and looking out for yourself. Maybe you feel like you escaped, and now you can take your degree and get that fancy job and the nice house and the nice car — and never look back. And don’t get me wrong — with all those student loans you’ve had to take out, I know you’ve got to earn some money. With doors open to you that your parents and grandparents could not even imagine, no one expects you to take a vow of poverty. But I will say it betrays a poverty of ambition if all you think about is what goods you can buy instead of what good you can do. (Applause.)
So, yes, go get that law degree. But if you do, ask yourself if the only option is to defend the rich and the powerful, or if you can also find some time to defend the powerless. Sure, go get your MBA, or start that business. We need black businesses out there. But ask yourselves what broader purpose your business might serve, in putting people to work, or transforming a neighborhood. The most successful CEOs I know didn’t start out intent just on making money — rather, they had a vision of how their product or service would change things, and the money followed. (Applause.)

Some of you may be headed to medical school to become doctors. But make sure you heal folks in underserved communities who really need it, too. For generations, certain groups in this country — especially African Americans — have been desperate in need of access to quality, affordable health care. And as a society, we’re finally beginning to change that. Those of you who are under the age of 26 already have the option to stay on your parent’s health care plan. But all of you are heading into an economy where many young people expect not only to have multiple jobs, but multiple careers.

So starting October 1st, because of the Affordable Care Act — otherwise known as Obamacare — (applause) — you’ll be able to shop for a quality, affordable plan that’s yours and travels with you — a plan that will insure not only your health, but your dreams if you are sick or get in an accident. But we’re going to need some doctors to make sure it works, too. We’ve got to make sure everybody has good health in this country. It’s not just good for you, it’s good for this country. So you’re going to have to spread the word to your fellow young people.

Which brings me to a second point: Just as Morehouse has taught you to expect more of yourselves, inspire those who look up to you to expect more of themselves. We know that too many young men in our community continue to make bad choices. And I have to say, growing up, I made quite a few myself. Sometimes I wrote off my own failings as just another example of the world trying to keep a black man down. I had a tendency sometimes to make excuses for me not doing the right thing. But one of the things that all of you have learned over the last four years is there’s no longer any room for excuses. (Applause.)

I understand there’s a common fraternity creed here at Morehouse: “Excuses are tools of the incompetent used to build bridges to nowhere and monuments of nothingness.” Well, we’ve got no time for excuses. Not because the bitter legacy of slavery and segregation have vanished entirely; they have not. Not because racism and discrimination no longer exist; we know those are still out there. It’s just that in today’s hyperconnected, hypercompetitive world, with millions of young people from China and India and Brazil — many of whom started with a whole lot less than all of you did — all of them entering the global workforce alongside you, nobody is going to give you anything that you have not earned. (Applause.)

Nobody cares how tough your upbringing was. Nobody cares if you suffered some discrimination. And moreover, you have to remember that whatever you’ve gone through, it pales in comparison to the hardships previous generations endured — and they overcame them. And if they overcame them, you can overcome them, too. (Applause.)

You now hail from a lineage and legacy of immeasurably strong men — men who bore tremendous burdens and still laid the stones for the path on which we now walk. You wear the mantle of Frederick Douglass and Booker T. Washington, and Ralph Bunche and Langston Hughes, and George Washington Carver and Ralph Abernathy and Thurgood Marshall, and, yes, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. These men were many things to many people. And they knew full well the role that racism played in their lives. But when it came to their own accomplishments and sense of purpose, they had no time for excuses.

Every one of you have a grandma or an uncle or a parent who’s told you that at some point in life, as an African American, you have to work twice as hard as anyone else if you want to get by. I think President Mays put it even better: He said, “Whatever you do, strive to do it so well that no man living and no man dead, and no man yet to be born can do it any better.” (Applause.)

And I promise you, what was needed in Dr. Mays’s time, that spirit of excellence, and hard work, and dedication, and no excuses is needed now more than ever. If you think you can just get over in this economy just because you have a Morehouse degree, you’re in for a rude awakening. But if you stay hungry, if you keep hustling, if you keep on your grind and get other folks to do the same — nobody can stop you. (Applause.)

And when I talk about pursuing excellence and setting an example, I’m not just talking about in your professional life. One of today’s graduates, Frederick Anderson — where’s Frederick? Frederick, right here. (Applause.) I know it’s raining, but I’m going to tell about Frederick. Frederick started his college career in Ohio, only to find out that his high school sweetheart back in Georgia was pregnant. So he came back and enrolled in Morehouse to be closer to her. Pretty soon, helping raise a newborn and working night shifts became too much, so he started taking business classes at a technical college instead — doing everything from delivering newspapers to buffing hospital floors to support his family.

And then he enrolled at Morehouse a second time. But even with a job, he couldn’t keep up with the cost of tuition. So after getting his degree from that technical school, this father of three decided to come back to Morehouse for a third time. (Applause.) As Frederick says, “God has a plan for my life, and He’s not done with me yet.”

And today, Frederick is a family man, and a working man, and a Morehouse Man. (Applause.) And that’s what I’m asking all of you to do: Keep setting an example for what it means to be a man. (Applause.) Be the best husband to your wife, or you’re your boyfriend, or your partner. Be the best father you can be to your children. Because nothing is more important.

I was raised by a heroic single mom, wonderful grandparents — made incredible sacrifices for me. And I know there are moms and grandparents here today who did the same thing for all of you. But I sure wish I had had a father who was not only present, but involved.
Didn’t know my dad. And so my whole life, I’ve tried to be for Michelle and my girls what my father was not for my mother and me. I want to break that cycle where a father is not at home — (applause) — where a father is not helping to raise that son or daughter. I want to be a better father, a better husband, a better man.

It’s hard work that demands your constant attention and frequent sacrifice. And I promise you, Michelle will tell you I’m not perfect. She’s got a long list of my imperfections. (Laughter.) Even now, I’m still practicing, I’m still learning, still getting corrected in terms of how to be a fine husband and a good father. But I will tell you this: Everything else is unfulfilled if we fail at family, if we fail at that responsibility. (Applause.)

I know that when I am on my deathbed someday, I will not be thinking about any particular legislation I passed; I will not be thinking about a policy I promoted; I will not be thinking about the speech I gave, I will not be thinking the Nobel Prize I received. I will be thinking about that walk I took with my daughters. I’ll be thinking about a lazy afternoon with my wife. I’ll be thinking about sitting around the dinner table and seeing them happy and healthy and knowing that they were loved. And I’ll be thinking about whether I did right by all of them.

So be a good role model, set a good example for that young brother coming up. If you know somebody who’s not on point, go back and bring that brother along — those who’ve been left behind, who haven’t had the same opportunities we have — they need to hear from you. You’ve got to be engaged on the barbershops, on the basketball court, at church, spend time and energy and presence to give people opportunities and a chance. Pull them up, expose them, support their dreams. Don’t put them down.

We’ve got to teach them just like what we have to learn, what it means to be a man — to serve your city like Maynard Jackson; to shape the culture like Spike Lee; to be like Chester Davenport, one of the first people to integrate the University of Georgia Law School. When he got there, nobody would sit next to him in class. But Chester didn’t mind. Later on, he said, “It was the thing for me to do. Someone needed to be the first.” And today, Chester is here celebrating his 50th reunion. Where is Chester Davenport? He’s here. (Applause.)

So if you’ve had role models, fathers, brothers like that — thank them today. And if you haven’t, commit yourself to being that man to somebody else.

And finally, as you do these things, do them not just for yourself, but don’t even do them just for the African American community. I want you to set your sights higher. At the turn of the last century, W.E.B. DuBois spoke about the “talented tenth” — a class of highly educated, socially conscious leaders in the black community. But it’s not just the African American community that needs you. The country needs you. The world needs you.

As Morehouse Men, many of you know what it’s like to be an outsider; know what it’s like to be marginalized; know what it’s like to feel the sting of discrimination. And that’s an experience that a lot of Americans share. Hispanic Americans know that feeling when somebody asks them where they come from or tell them to go back. Gay and lesbian Americans feel it when a stranger passes judgment on their parenting skills or the love that they share. Muslim Americans feel it when they’re stared at with suspicion because of their faith. Any woman who knows the injustice of earning less pay for doing the same work — she knows what it’s like to be on the outside looking in.

So your experiences give you special insight that today’s leaders need. If you tap into that experience, it should endow you with empathy — the understanding of what it’s like to walk in somebody else’s shoes, to see through their eyes, to know what it’s like when you’re not born on 3rd base, thinking you hit a triple. It should give you the ability to connect. It should give you a sense of compassion and what it means to overcome barriers.

And I will tell you, Class of 2013, whatever success I have achieved, whatever positions of leadership I have held have depended less on Ivy League degrees or SAT scores or GPAs, and have instead been due to that sense of connection and empathy — the special obligation I felt, as a black man like you, to help those who need it most, people who didn’t have the opportunities that I had — because there but for the grace of God, go I — I might have been in their shoes. I might have been in prison. I might have been unemployed. I might not have been able to support a family. And that motivates me. (Applause.)

So it’s up to you to widen your circle of concern — to care about justice for everybody, white, black and brown. Everybody. Not just in your own community, but also across this country and around the world. To make sure everyone has a voice, and everybody gets a seat at the table; that everybody, no matter what you look like or where you come from, what your last name is — it doesn’t matter, everybody gets a chance to walk through those doors of opportunity if they are willing to work hard enough.

When Leland Shelton was four years old — where’s Leland? (Applause.) Stand up, Leland. When Leland Shelton was four years old, social services took him away from his mama, put him in the care of his grandparents. By age 14, he was in the foster care system. Three years after that, Leland enrolled in Morehouse. And today he is graduating Phi Beta Kappa on his way to Harvard Law School. (Applause.) But he’s not stopping there. As a member of the National Foster Care Youth and Alumni Policy Council, he plans to use his law degree to make sure kids like him don’t fall through the cracks. And it won’t matter whether they’re black kids or brown kids or white kids or Native American kids, because he’ll understand what they’re going through. And he’ll be fighting for them. He’ll be in their corner. That’s leadership. That’s a Morehouse Man right there. (Applause.)

That’s what we’ve come to expect from you, Morehouse — a legacy of leaders — not just in our black community, but for the entire American community. To recognize the burdens you carry with you, but to resist the temptation to use them as excuses. To transform the way we think about manhood, and set higher standards for ourselves and for others. To be successful, but also to understand that each of us has responsibilities not just to ourselves, but to one another and to future generations. Men who refuse to be afraid. Men who refuse to be afraid.

Members of the Class of 2013, you are heirs to a great legacy. You have within you that same courage and that same strength, the same resolve as the men who came before you. That’s what being a Morehouse Man is all about. That’s what being an American is all about.

Success may not come quickly or easily. But if you strive to do what’s right, if you work harder and dream bigger, if you set an example in your own lives and do your part to help meet the challenges of our time, then I’m confident that, together, we will continue the never-ending task of perfecting our union.

Congratulations, Class of 2013. God bless you. God bless Morehouse. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)3Embed"
The Smiths,Still Ill - 2011 Remaster,"96 Contributors2015 College Essay Peer Editing LyricsESSAYS THAT STILL NEED SOME LOVE!!!WHAT DO I DO ONCE I'VE RECEIVED FEEDBACK?1st PeriodPrompt: Discuss the greatest challenge you have faced or expect to face.

I expect college to be a challenge. It may not be the most difficult challenge but it would be formidable. However, like any challenge I have faced it will be crushed.

I’ll have to learn new concepts that are at least new to me. I might be perplexed by the way the system functions. However, I have a general idea of how college will operate. I just don’t have all the details. Will I like the professor? Will I not? I don’t know much about it. I will have to find out.
I know the expectations will be different than any typical high school. Also, some high schools are more challenging than college. I’ll have to adapt to the new environment and change my study habits. College could also be easy. I don’t know. I still have many questions and I’ll assume that they will be answered. I guess it will be a new adventure. I still don’t really know. It’s just another step up.

Even if I’m entering strange territory, I’m still confident; I’ll see what they throw at me. I know that we can request are classes to be spread out and if this is the case it will be easier because of the extra time per class. Whether it’s challenging or easy I’ll finish it.Prompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.

“My mama always used to tell me: ‘If you can’t find somethin’ to live for, you best find somethin' to die for,” – Tupac Shakur. My greatest influence is Tupac Shakur. His words have always resonated with me. I’ve looked up to him since I was a young boy. I credit my father for introducing me to my greatest role model outside of my family.

“A coward dies a thousand times, a soldier dies but once.” The best influence I gained from Mr. Shakur was to have a strong heart, will, and mind. With these things intact no way you can be deterred by anyone else. Letting someone break your down your heart to fight to can break your will. If you lose your will you can become weak minded and you need all three to survive. It’s like he always said, “If you can make it through the night, there’s a brighter day.”
“I think I’m a natural-born leader. I know how to bow down to authority if it’s authority that I respect.” Another lesson I learned was to never give in to anyone and say what’s on your mind. The first amendment is the right to freedom of speech. Shakur believed that we all should exercise this right. He also believed that no badge of authority is just given respect but, it is earned just as anyone else will have to earn it. “Sh*t, I like to think that at every opportunity I’ve ever been threatened with resistance, it’s been met with resistance. And not only me but it goes down my family tree. You know what I’m saying, it’s in my veins to fight back.” It was in his blood to fight back that’s why he’ll never bow down to just any authority.

“I see myself as a natural born hustler, a true hustler in every sense of the word. I took nothin’, I took the opportunities, I worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it. I went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the person that works my management company. I changed everything I realized my destiny in a matter of five years you know what I’m saying I made myself a millionaire. I made millions for a lot of people now it’s time to make millions for myself; you know what I’m saying. I made millions for the record companies; I made millions for these movie companies, now I make millions for us” here he says he worked and earned every penny he has and gained his respect along with it. Hard work gives you everything you deserve.Prompt: What makes you, you?

My life had many ups and downs, when I was a baby I was filled with smiles, laughed all the time, but that soon changed. I became an angry child or waterfalls of tears would run off may face during my child hood. Over time I learned to accept life, and then I learned to be happy. And I became a rosy cheek kid that tries to live an easy going life.

when I was a kid with a face as red as a burring flame on the sun and sad, it all seem to be tied to how my life was going, my father was arrested and I could only see him for short times compared to when I spent entire days with him. I started living with people I barely knew but my mom new quite well, these people where called grandparents. And the things I always knew where changing for the rest of my life and it was a lot for a kid of four to take in and, caused pain for many years.

Later in my life the streams if tears flowed so rapidly that soon I tried to make dams of rope at the line of the neck. My grandfather that I did not know as I child I learned to love like a second father had passed. So with the dames at a brake I knew it was time for a change. Whenever I would feel down I would search the ends of the earth to find the good in what is happening so that helped me learn how to except the negative thing that happen in my life. Once my grandfather passed who we depended on with most of our lives, poverty had soon come. We struggled to feed our self’s and we ended up having to move to a house a third of the size of what we once had. With that I learned to enjoy a loaf of bread instead of wanting a five course meal.

With all the challenges that happened in my life I grew to a bigger, stronger, and better person. Through my whole life the warmth of a mother hug and the kiss from the heart a grandmother gives when times seem blue helped me adapt the love and care I try to share with others. In the past I was a heated person temper as strong as an ox. But there is only so much anger a person can handle in their life and over time I became to be where only the biggest things can makes my blood boil. After having a past of anger and people who said I was weird and a nut, I decided to let it roll off the cheek and became determined to still be that nut but be the best I can, I adapted determination from that point on.
Through the roller coaster of my life I’ve lived hard painful times, with loss of love ones and massive changes. And I’ve had good times as well with love and happiness. People would think on how I was as a child I would be this miserable adult but they were wrong. I am living proof that challenges as hard as they may come can make a better person. I was a dark souled being that changed into a great, loving and, caring person. Who is determined and fallows my dreams.Prompt: Describe an important transition in your life.

Since we were born we were told how important college is, we were told that we should already know what we want to do, and what college we want to attend. Even though we really don’t have any fore knowledge on what college really is, we are still expected to go. This, to me is the hardest transition anyone can face, making it the most important.

Figuring out what you want to be when you grow up, we have been asked this question ever since the beginning of public school, kindergarten. Isn’t it ridiculous? Asking a five year what he/she wants to do when she/he is 20. Back then we all were oblivious to how fast life really moves; we didn’t know that outside of crayons and story time, there was a world waiting to be explored. Even though we had no idea where money comes from, or how a government works, we were still asked, “what do you want to be when you grow up?” Present day, that question triggers anxiety, and pent up confusion, because the answer isn’t as simple as “rock star” anymore, now you need a real answer.

People say that high school is the best years of school you will ever have, because we can’t go back to it. Make your friends now, keep up with your grades, join school clubs, and get a part time job, pay your dues, graduate. It’s either now or never, go big or get a GED.
Being pressured into going to college is probably the worst thing that can happen to anyone, it isn’t the 1960’s anymore, and we have other options. With tuition rising and employment decreasing, graduating college and getting a job is harder than ever, not to mention student loans.

That’s why I feel this transition is so important, it opens the eyes of our generation, and things aren’t easy. We’ve all been handed a crystal clear picture of going to college being the only thing we can do. Growing up happens fast, and this still goes for the lucky ones that already have an idea of what they want to do after high school. For us, graduation will be the strangest feeling, no more school, no more summer break, no more standardized tests, we will all be floating around in our cap and gown trying to grasp the fact that we are done. I think that’s when you actually become an adult, because; isn’t that what adulthood is? Just a bunch of kids trying to figure everything out. That’s what makes this transition an important one, because it’s the hardest one we will face.Prompt: Discuss some issue of personal, local, or national concern and its importance to you

Police Brutality is a national concern we need to put an end to. The people who are supposed to be protecting us are killing us! We the people must eliminate this racism and brutality in our police force. There is no time to waste action must be takin now.

Brutality is not the way anyone should go. Our right as a citizen must be protected at all times. Nobody is above our rights or laws. Black minorities are the main people targeted by this threat. Most people would’ve thought we’ve move passed this racism. Equality is what needs to be seen in the eyes of not just officers but everyone.

In my own experience I’ve seen white cops treat other races (Mainly Blacks) as if they were animals. We are no different than anyone else. Cops need to accept the fact that we are all the same on the inside. People are getting shot and killed for no reason. In the United States, major political and social movements have involved excessive force by police.Prompt:  “Describe a Person who has Influenced Your Life- Grandpa”

As the sun began to peak through the fine curtains, I clenched my eyes and inhale the sweet odor of homemade biscuits and smoky sausages specially made by my pleasurable grand-mama. My limps felt detached and strained but my stomach was roaring another tune, soon became in debate with worn-out body. I eased to the edge of the bed leisurely took a quick glance at the clock. I didn’t bother reading the time though; I just know it was too early to hear that faint bussing outside. It was Saturday morning and the routine remained the same as always, I shimmied over to the one window facing the back yard already knowing what I was searching for, my grand-daddy.

My grand-daddy wore a plaid red and black shirt, faded blue jean overalls and some dusty old work boot to mow the lawn in the early morning as, he rode his lawn mower from side to side and every few seconds he would briefly slowed down to spit his burnt sienna colored chewing tobacco, wipe his mouth with a bright white handkerchief and continue his journey.

My grand-daddy is the chief of the Totten family. Born and raised in Yanceyville, North Carolina. He received only a 5th grade education and from there worked in the family business of farmers. He is the second youngest of four brothers and a sister. Out of all of his siblings except his sister he was the only one to ever go to school and come out with a work ethic of devotion. He puts his all in everything he does from head to toe this man has gave honor to the Totten’s name.Prompt:  Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on me, and describe that influence. The one person who has changed my life the most has to be both of my brother’s for good and bad.

My brothers have had the most influence on me because I don’t want to be anything like at all. They both have been in and out of jail not for anything big like rape or murder but for dumb things like weed. But it’s not the fact that they went to jail that scary me and makes me not want to be anything like them but it the fact I seen everything that my mother has gone through because of brother’s and that’s what makes me want to be nothing like them fools.

So yea that’s why I don’t want to be anything like my bothers they are good for nothing that just mess things up in my life and everyone else life there even messing up your life right now you don’t even know it. But for real if anyone how had impacted my life it would be them for the fact that I don’t want to be like them. But then you could look at it for another point of view and say they actually are good because of their massive mistake now I wound not make the same mistake they did.Topic: The Place That I Know Well
Texas is the place that I know well. I have been to Texas lots of times in my life. Texas is a great place to be at. There are lots of things that you can do in Texas. It is a place that you ca have a great time and also relaxes. It is the place that I know bather than anything else in the world.

Texas is where most of the things happen. You can feel the heat thrower your skin as you get closer to Texas. You can see lots of different things happening at the same time. Lots of cars passing by you as you go thrower the highway. There are lots of restaurant where you can eat at. You can small the different foods once you go inside the restaurant. Texas is as big as the United States.

Every time I go to Texas I just can just relaxes all day. I feel happy every time I go there. It is the place that can make you feel safe at all times. It is where I can see lots of things that can make you feel happy. For example every time I go to the beach I have a great time there. Also when I go to see family members and have a great time with them.Prompt: If you offered the role of the villain or the hero in a movie, which role would you accept and why?

Here come Jaeblast!! As the crowd would scream as I enter a nearby metropolis to save the day from evil. The role of a super hero is one role I would consider a choice of picking. Having superpower would be insane for me to decline that role because I would see myself as a protagonist and I believe I’m a good person by heart and soul.

I believe in superhero’s since the day I could open my eyes. As the year passed my inspiration for the famous superhero Flash has grown over time. Flash has been Favorable to me due to the fact that he was a scientist in his own field in which I’m going to college to study/Major in. Whenever I see or watch Flash I think of myself in a scientific/energetic way of thinking. The flash was a scientist before he was even notice as a hero of the comic books.Prompt: “Advice you can give to students just starting their high school career”

There are many advantages of going to high school and staying there for the full time that you should be there. At the same time there are many pitfalls and students can become confuse by the many decisions that we are forced to make. In most cases high school students want to make the best decisions about their future, and so it is important to learn of the various resources available to help make the right decisions as they will make an impact on life after high school.

There are many advantages of going to high school. High school will provide you with many opportunities that will help to develop life-long skills such as learning, social and mental development. High school helped me to lay down foundations for growth and development so that I can become a productive and good member of the community. The knowledge presented in high school can help build the necessary foundations for a career you may be interested in. Students can learn various subjects such as business, health, sciences, trades, skills and technology, all of which can be apply to knowledge needed for careers in these fields or other fields. Experiences in high school can also provide you with opportunities for career development. In high school students can meet partners in business, science, technology and other fields and they can learn about these careers and professions from experts in the field. In some high schools, experts come in on career day and talk to the students about the various careers and professions. I always love when they come in. These events can also help students to decide what careers they want to get into when the leave high school.

Another benefit is that going to high school helps students to build relationships with people such as teachers and other professionals in the fields already. When these professionals come in on career day, students can build professional relationships. You can get the experts as mentors and preceptors in the field. In high school you will also build relationships with each other and agree to go to college together. For me, I have very few friends that I can continue to be friendly with and hopefully go to college with. Some students would go to the same college and enter into the same or similar fields and in doing so long lasting friendly and work career relationships can be created. Another advantage in attending high school is that you get to learn about new methods and new technology in the workplace so that they can be more prepared when they leave school.

There are many resources in high schools that with help benefit students. High school will prepare students to make better decisions about careers and about colleges where they can advance and go into careers, or further studies that they may want to do. Sometimes, I am not sure what job or profession I want to do after I leave school. The guidance counselors in high school will hopefully help to guide and direct my career paths. Resources such as libraries, career centers, and academies like science academy or technology academy can help me to learn about these specific fields. Schools have resources such as the internet that I can use to learn more about colleges and careers. There are also many resources such as books, brochures and pamphlets that will tell me about careers and colleges.

While there are many advantages of going to high school and many resources to guide you, there are just as many pitfalls that can be misleading and dangerous. The large amounts of decisions that confront students can be overwhelming. Students may find pressure to make decisions and may rush into making decisions that they are not comfortable making. You might also rush and make decisions to please your parents. Sometimes I feel like I am being rushed by my mother to make a decision, but I have to remind her that I need to make my mind up. Another pitfall is that students could just be following their friends. Peer pressure could push students to make the wrong decisions for college, or peer pressure may force students to drop out of school. In high school you cannot cave into peer pressure. I had to make a personal decision for myself. High school students must be strong and make decisions best for themselves and their families. Another pitfall in high school is that students may become overwhelm by the many resources offered in school and that may result in the student not making the best and most timely decision.

To help with the pitfall that may occur in high school, I need to remain positive and seek the resources that will help me to do well and stay in school. Students should go to school and learn the school work. You should also do your homework and ask for help when needed. Students should go to their guidance counselors, or their teachers for additional help when necessary. Sometimes I feel uncomfortable asking for help. You need learn important skills like asking for help, talking with the teachers, being responsible and respecting to the teachers. These simple skills can help you to stay in school, do assignments and home work so you can get good grades, a good grade point average and meet all graduation requirements.

Going to a different elementary school s every year or every other year wasn’t always easy. Living with that transition as a kid wasn’t easy at all to make friends. Events like birthday parties and having people over were always difficult to set up because I didn’t really have a group of base friends that I grew up with. Plus my parents are the type that they have to meet the others kids’ parents for me to even come to a sleepover.
Imagine being eight years old , walking into a new elementary school , not knowing a face in the school with butterflies in your stomach wondering how it’s all going to turnout . That was me at least four different times back in my elementary days. I would say the hardest task was to try and fit in. Every day was a new challenge to face because everyone knew each other and it was like I was the only crumbled cookie in a fresh new pack of opened Oreos. My teacher did try and make it better by doing all the introductions and trying to fit me in but I was still the odd ball in the pack. Plus as a kid was very timid, some would say anti-social, so that definitely didn’t help me. Honestly sometimes I even tried not to make friends because I knew I was going to end up moving.Prompt: Greatest challenge I have ever faced

Moving away from the place I was raised in and lived the most of my life was very hard for me and my family. It was scary, but at the same time it’s exciting to explore the new beginning of our life. My mind was thinking that if I move away from all my loved one and friends, I won’t be able to see them again and I’m afraid I won’t be able to make any new friends in United States.

After living in the Philippines for almostPrompt: “Discuss what makes you uniquely qualified for college”

College is the next essential step; it is also the most talked about after you finish high school. The reason college is known for being so hard is because high school graduates don’t really know what they want to be. People their age rarely know what they want to be. Myself I have spent countless hours discovering what I would like to accomplish. Anyone can say they want to do something; it takes some drive and execution to pursue something you enjoy. There are many cases where I could have quit and people would have loved to see me fail. At the end of all that I just had to remember why I was doing it, and was it worth fighting for. To prove them wrong I work hard for whatever it took a months or years. I just had to stay determined and put all my essential qualities to use.

High School is a rough time for some students. Students are figuring out what they want to become and finding out who they are. 50% – 70% of students change their majors at least once; most will change majors at least 3 times before they graduate. Not only knowing what you want to do is important, finding out whom you are necessary as well. Why is this important as a college student? Many students when they get to college don’t have the hard work and will power to continue. Students don’t know what works for them to be successful. I have spent many methods on how to plan and make myself successful.

Someone once told me that they’re a difference between listening and learning. Anyone can listen but only some can learn. It is the same concept on having idea/dream, and someone who peruses their aspirations. I had teachers before that told me that “You would not go anywhere”. The only thing the teachers didn’t know was I did not take their “advice” into consideration. I kept myself from going the wrong way. The steps I took were I did all I could do, and if I was failing behind I made up the work. I continuing doing well and showed my teachers wrong. I could have quit and not cared but I was motivated because I had a goal to achieve.

Hard work over weights anything I notice that hard work is like practice. Everyone knows the saying that “Practice makes perfect”. No matter how bad you are at something the amount of time I’ve practice takes an effect. I have put so much hard work into school. That I’m ready for a new challenge college is that next step. I have prepared my whole life to get this opportunity. With all the knowledge I have learn from preparing and my high school practice college I am ready for college.

With all the things I have learned during my school years and my life lessons. I have learn a lot of new thing and will look forward to learning new things in college.Prompt: “Describe an important transition in your life”

It was my first year of high school. I was excited and nervous at the same time I was excited because it was a new beginning for me. It what significant to me because it was a big change for me. I was going from middle school to high school.

The alarm goes off it is now 5:00 a.m. it is time for me to get ready for school. I get off my bed and go brush my teeth then go into in to the shower. The water was freezing cold. When I got out the shower I rushed to my room and start getting ready. The time flew by so quickly. I got ready on time. I had few minutes before I had to go to the bus stop. I ate some cereal before leaving. Once, I left to bus stop I was walking with my sister. I arrived at the bus stop it was near the road where the cars were passing. The wind was blowing in my face because of the cars racing in the road. I could see the red lights flashing on the bus. The bus is getting near I start shaking and my hands are getting sweaty. I get on the bus and it feels as if I was walking into an oven it was hot.

Furthermore, we are getting near the school and I get afraid. I don’t know what is it like to be in high school and it will be a new experience for me. We finally arrive at school. There are many buses there also. Suddenly, they yell out “unload” when they say that it means to open the door and let us out of the bus. Everyone starts rushing off the bus and I am patiently waiting for my turn. I get off the bus and start walking into the school. I walk in the school and there are lots of people. I am squeezing in between the crowd. I finally walk through everyone and it is time to look for my classes. I think to myself I don’t know where my classes are the good thing is that there were teachers in mostly each corner. I got to all my classes. I would look around to see if I had any friends in that class. Luckily, I had at least one friend in each class. I just wanted the day to be over as soon as possible. The thing that got me nervous was that my sister would always tell me, “high school is not easy.” The first day isn’t that bad because the only thing we do is get informed of what we will expect and our expectations and what we will learn during the year.

Additionally, for me the transition from middle school to high school was a big change for me. The reason being is because I was already getting use to walking up later like around 7:00 a.m. Then, the following year having to wake up at 5:00 a.m. was a change. I had to get use to waking up at that time. It was hard because the first days I would wake up at the right time then, I would go back to sleep. I missed the bus a few times. I managed to get over that with time. The only thing I didn’t like is that I had seven classes. The other thing was that the classes were very apart from each other. For example, I had to walk from one building to another one in five minutes. Overall, I liked all my classes. For me high school was easy as long as I did my work. They start getting us ready for college.Prompt: “Discuss the greatest challenge you have face or expect to face”

Challenge? What is a challenge? It’s something that you have to accomplish or something you have to face. Well everyone has challenges. Small ones, big ones but I never thought I would face the biggest one ever. That is my dad death. I had no idea it was going to happen that fast. So that’s the biggest challenge I have to face in my life. It was so unexpected I have to face. My life has change since that day.

It began on June 30, 2014 that afternoon. I was hanging out with my friend Stefany. It was a great day. She left to go home. I went inside to my room. Then my mom got a call from my aunt. She told her that my dad had passed away. She came to my room. She told me and my sister that my dad has passed away. When I heard the bad news tears where rolling down my face. I had to call my older brother to tell him the news. He answers and when I told him. He was like your lying I’m like no I’m not. It was grandma all over. We went to see him in the hospital. It was the hardest thing I have to face to see. I almost fell to the ground and one of my aunts caught me. All the family was full of sadness and we couldn’t accept it. Later on that week it was his funeral. It was on Wednesday July 2, 2014. In the memorial service we were crying our tears out. When my family saw him it was horrible that we have to see him like that. During the service the ladies sung this song call “Yo Te Extranare” which it means I’ll miss you. That song is a dialogue of me and my dad talking. Every time listen to that song I always cry and be in pain, because it reminds me of him. Ever since the funeral nothing would make be happy.

On that Saturday that week. We had this church event which took place in the park that my dad would always take me. That was also the park behind where my grandma and dad work. That day memories just came to me and tears came out too. So I walk around and cry my eyes out. When I was walking around. My mom was telling the people from church that my dad died that week. And she also told them that I was the most effected about it. Anyways ever since my dad passed away my life change a lot. All my friends ask me how you can live life still without your dad. I’m like I just don’t think about as much. Ever since then I haven’t been the same girl that I used to be. My religious beliefs change and so has my personalities. I’ve suffering for my dad death and for something else I can’t say. Every time I’m going somewhere. Something always reminds me of him and my memories come back. Oh also when I go to my grandpa house. I always think my dad is going to be there even though I should know he’s not there. I just can’t accept that he’s gone. My family and my friends say “It’s okay [...] your dad is now in peace and not suffering”. I’m like “No now I’m the one suffering “. I wanted him to see me graduate and see I made it. He saw my brother graduate and now he won’t see me. He would always tell me when he was here. “Ya me voy a morir” Which means I’m going to die. I hated that he would always say that. I would tell him “Pa no tengas eso” which means “Dad don’t say that”. So my life has complete became a suffering life.
As can be seen life is so short. I want to live my life. Since my dad is no longer here I want him to know I’m doing everything so I would be successful. I want to become a writer, singer, and also an actress. He’s the only person that supported me on what I wanted to do with my life. So when I become one of those dreams of mine. I own it all to my dad. He made me what I am now and I want to accomplish everything I need to do. Now I’m not suffering as much for his death because I know he’s not suffering. And soon I would be with him. So this was the greatest challenge I have to face and still facing.Prompt: What are the three specific things you plan to do in Florida?

The three specific things I plan to do at Florida is focusing on class, basketball, and wanting on to become a more responsible person. I want to build the best educate for me. Be known as one of the best student –athlete who came to Florida State. To be known to teachers on my skills of focus. To be remember as an elite player that played the game. To be one of the best player on and off the court.

My focus is coming to Florida with a good mindset. My study habits would be up to par while in the hot steaming room with no A/C. my sweat would fall off my forehead like bullet shells. As I try to write a perfect paper. As I am proof reading the paper for the professor to receive the fulfilling grade of success.

As I’m done with my work for class I head to the gym with coach and the guys. As we practice on our plays for the games. While me and the team breathe hard with exhaustion. The coaches would let us take a break and drink a cold bottle of Gatorade. While we drink and take a break we discussed about getting the sunny beach college sate a championship.

As we end practice I’ll go off campus to go work and find a way to stay productive. To stay on the right path and let others go on the wrong. As I drive on the smooth road with the bright glowing sun hits my face. I would go out to find a job and make some more money to pay for books and food to live on. Then after work I’ll go to the donation and give the clothes that I don’t wear any more. I would clean up the streets of Florida to help the community out with a place to claim for good and clean areas.Prompt: Evaluate a significant experience or achievement that has a special meaning to you.

Many people have achieved different things in their lives. Some have achieved to get scholarships. Other where able to go pro in a sport they loved. There are a lot of achievements that people have been able to accomplish. A significant experience or achievement that has a special meaning to me is when I made it to Varsity Cross-Country.

The first time that I joined Cross-Country I saw that there were many good runners. That inspired me to try to be the best runner for the team. I attended practice every day and gave it all I had. But one of my biggest obstacles that was stopping me from being the best was my knee pain. My knee pain was really bad and that was slowing me down big time. Therefore my sophomore season wasn’t the best; I wasn’t able to become the best runner for Berkmar.

After I did therapy for my knee and I relaxed my joins I went back to running. But this time I did something different that I dint do the first time, I went to summer conditioning. Summer conditioning helped me out big time to become better and achieve my goal. I ran all summer long with the team; luckily I wasn’t having any knee pain. After summer conditioning finished our Cross-Country season started again. I was determined to achieve my goal that year. Two weeks into the season and we had our first race of the year. After getting an 18:29 for a 3.1 mile race I knew I was on track to achieving my goal. I kept working hard to get even better and by the time you know it I was top varsity for Berkmar High School. I finished that year with my best time of 17:52.

This year I am setting a new goal. That goal is to beat my personal record that I set last year. I’m going to put even more work in and I’m going to try more hard to achieve that goal. I know that I focus on my goal I’ll be able to reach it. The goal I am setting for this season it to run a 17:00 flat or less if possible.

My main goal that I had was been to become a varsity runner. That goal has been accomplished, now I have to set new goals so I can keep making accomplishments in life. A new goal I have is to beat my personal record of 17:52 and hopefully get a Cross-Country scholarship. Overall the achievement that has a special meaning to me is the fact I was able to become varsity for Berkmar High School.Prompt: ”Evaluate a significant experience or achievement that that has special meaning to you.”

One of the greatest achievements is to graduate and fulfill all the dreams and goals that I have set for myself. This world is full of people that had set goals, and dreams but never did anything to make them come true. I don’t want to be one more of those people that don’t do anything to not make them; I will do whatever it takes just to make it happen. I want these not only for myself but I part for my family. They have been there sense day one and I appreciate all their support.

Why do I say that I don’t only want it for me but for my family? Because, my family has been there for me without thinking about it twice, they have had my back, no matter what they will always be there. They push me to do my very best all the time, and tell me every time that I should never stop fighting for what I want, if I want it to go for it. Even when the get too pushy and very stressful I know they don’t do it to frustrate me they do it because they care and want me to do good in life and even though I feel like they pressure me sometimes I know it’s because they care.

By me graduating and entering college, would be the best achievement ever not only because I prove myself that I could do but because I would be making my mom prude, and for all of those people that didn’t have faith in me or never believe that I could have done it. I want to give the best I have and be successful. My mother is one thing that push me the most to do good, and I want to make her proud and show her that I can do it, and by that I will be giving her back a little out of all that she has gave me.

That is the main achievement that I have in mind, the one that is going to take me far in life the one that I’m going to be proud to say that I made it and that I did it all by myself, with hard effort but I made it. Everybody is born with a purpose in life, I know mine. Now the only thing I have left is to get to it and do anything it takes to get it done.Think of a place you know well. Describe the place and include feelings about it.

Have you ever wanted to go back in time, and visit that one place that brings a smile to your face? Meanwhile that exact place is so far from your reach, and on the other hand it’s extremely close to your heart. When I think of that place I only imagine Guatemala. There are three areas in Guatemala that I enjoy tremendously which are in some ways very different and similar at the same time.
Venecia, Guatemala is one of these areas that I adore to stay at. Primarily I’m fondled at the fact that my mom was born around this district. Also her parents and my grandparents still live there to this day. Every time I go spend time over there I fancy walking through the high stalks of green corn and getting lost for hours with my little cousin Yasmin. Another thing I’m delighted by is the morning breeze hugging my skin so tight that goose bumps appear throughout by body. Evenings were even better; my grandmother would stir up a cup of coco for my sister and me and included bread on the side to make the experience even more outstanding. I won’t ever forget the time when my sister and I put ten baby chicks in a circle and surrounded them with something. After a few seconds we would lift that something and the chicks would run in every direction. The place was to collect each one of the chicks until we got ten again. This specific moment made me feel butterflies and fireworks inside my tummy. Every single time I go to visit the moment is extremely pleasant and unforgettable. My heart speeds up every time I am able to go to Guatemala.

Another place I’m exited in Guatemala to spend time at is chela. Chela is located near the city. It’s three hours from the city but a hot sweaty three hours in the car. My mom’s little brother Rudy lives there in a two story home. I love going there because I get to share moments with my baby cousin. I remember once my brother, sister and I went to a water park like thirty minutes away. My eyes almost popped out of my head once I saw the price of each ticket. Each one of us had to pay one hundred quetzals, which is the name of the currency in Guatemala. In U.S currency it would vary from fourteen to fifteen dollars. The money didn’t really bother me at the end of the day. I saw huge slide with people shouting and screaming. The one ride that is unforgettable to me was the one where all three of us got into one float and were pushed in a giant swirling slide and we at got wet and at the end of the slide was a pool where we fell into. My heart was racing the entire time we were there. After the water park we headed back to my uncle’s house where we ate a fish that was whole and looking at me. This started to make my stomach to move from the smile on my face. After a few weeks my other grandparents, my dad’s parents came to pick my sister and I up to go stay with them until the day we had to come back to Georgia.

My father’s parents live the closest to the city. Its one and a half hours away. The interesting part of Chimaltenango, Guatemala is that it’s always mid-warm there and I love the sun beating against my skin. I adore helping out in my grandfather’s store where he basically sells everybody’s needs. The benefit of being his granddaughter was that I basically owned his store as well. What I mean by that was I could take anything and pig out on whatever I craved. Luckily that wasn’t the only thing to do at their house. At times I would help my grandma water all her crops such as bananas,plantans,mangosPrompt: A person that who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.

They say ‘Never Judge A book by Its Cover “, but why does everyone still judge me because of the carrier I want to take or the job I would love to have. People are always telling me what to do and what is best for me, but I don’t want what happen to my cousin happening to me. I really want to be a doctor’s assistants and I will be because I have the skills for it.

My cousin always wanted to travel the world, but her parents never let her do what she wanted to do with her life, since they were the ones who were paying her college and her books. People and family members would always judge her because they thought she would never get to that level since most of us were poor. She knew that one day she was going to be traveling to many countries, and luckily the United States government sent a letter to her school asking for a voluntary helper to go to out the country and help others. When everyone doubt it her, she always believed in herself.

From the time I was able to realize that the U.C (University Of California) was the best for me and my future, I decide to do my research on it.2nd PeriodPrompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.

Through out the good and the bad and the ugly she has been there. When i was sick feeling like i was on my death bed,she was there. When i just plainly need someone to talk to or a friend she was always there. That person is my mom. My mother has made the greatest influence on my life out of everyone i have know to this day. Throughout all the struggle she, me and my family as a whole she has been there and she was the one to keep it all together and kept a smile on her face even when she felt like she could just leave ,she stayed and fought through it all. She was my mother.

My moms name is Yezzet Lewis Thomas. She is a Licensed Practical Nurses or LPN and she is working on her RN degree (Registered Nurses). Born in France moved to the United States when she was 2 and has 9 brothers and sisters her family was a military family with her dad serving in the military. One reason i chose her to be my biggest influence on me is the fact she was always there for me. when i was younger from Elementary to Middle school I had a really hard time making friends and had lots of issues with me being bullied and my constant stutter did not make it any better from my point of view, It just gave others more ammo to fire at me day after day and i struggled with life. But i always knew i could come home and wait to 8 o'clock the time she gets off of work and just talk to her about it like she was my best friend. She was always on my side and when i needed stuff done school wise she would stay up late to help me even if she had to go back to work at 6 in the AM.Describe an important transition in your life.

My name was not called to participate in the 2014-2015 Peachtree Ridge, three day soccer tryouts. The coach said, “we do not have your physical on file”, but yet I turned mine in to the lady soccer adviser and she said she will put it in the day I gave it to her a week before. The JV coach told me to ask Coach Sutton, the Varsity coach, to see if I can still tryout. When I walked over to him, and informed him on the situation, he looked me up and down looking at how I was dressed, I am new to the soccer world so I had some; black vans, shorts and two hoodies on, that day was the day it started to snow, and he said, “well if it is not on file then I will not let you tryout.” I was outside for hours just practicing in the cold after school, from 2:10 to 5:00.
Being told in front of the whole soccer team and new comers, that you can’t tryout, is embarrassing, and it really hurts you. I knew I turned in my Physical Form but they “did not have it”. Later on that day of the tryouts, my mom emailed Coach Sutton, and informed him that I did turn it in to the Soccer Lady. So the Coach replies saying that I am able to come to the second day tryout and I will be evaluated closely during the tryout. I told my mom no, I will not go to the tryout because I will feel the pressure and know they are watching me closely, I also did not want not meet their standers and still not make the team. Plus, I did not have much experience to the game of soccer, so I thought it would be best of me to not go and work on my skills for the game till next year.

So from the day after the second tryout, I was practicing soccer left and right, outside working on ball control, my touches, juggling, and at parks working on my shooting. I have improved a lot from the tryouts. I am glad that I decided to go off and improve my skills, I am more confident to tryout now, but still will be nervous and feel the pressure. I moved schools my last year of high school, to Berkmar High school and I am trying out this year, I will be attending Conditioning, did not do it at Peachtree Ridge, but I will now. Seniors have to try out for Varsity and juniors too and then sophomores and freshman have to try out for JV. So I will be preparing myself for Varsity tryouts, and the Varsity Coach, is also my Psychology teacher. He knows I am trying out for soccer and has been informing me the updates on soccer. I got my physical done and now I am just getting myself ready for conditioning.

My future career goals with soccer, is to make it to an MLS (Major League Soccer) Team. MLS is only teams held in The United States, so American Teams. I have a few teams in mind, for example; Orlando FC, New York City, New York City Red Bulls and LA Galaxy. In 2017, Georgia will have their own MLS team, I would like to try them out first.

So ever since that day after tryouts, I have opened my mind to soccer, learned more about soccer and would to take it up a notch in my life. I may not be much good but all I can do from then and to the future is practice.Prompt: Discuss What Makes You Uniquely qualified for This Position

Not everyone is qualified for every job or career. I know I have the potential to be a police officer. Wearing the blue is not the easiest or most popular position right now but I am motivated to do it. Having the dream is the first step to a goal. However, having certain capabilities is also key to success in performing specific tasks. I am very perceptive so I can notice elements that are out of the ordinary that may disrupt society and I also possess a sense of justice to act out this role. I can see myself right now in the uniform and looking out across the street.
Perception is a necessary skill for all law enforcement. Without it, criminals would continue to wreak havoc and no one will be any the wiser. If a situation seems off, I will notice. I know the symptoms of being under the influence of hard drugs: drowsiness, hyperactivity, sweating, irritability, paranoia. Liars will not fool me either. I will note the delay and uncertainty in a person’s response and the many gestures that accompany deceit. Then I will politely ask for the truth. There is another sense that is required for this position.

A sense of justice is a key component to upholding the law. The privilege of safeguarding other people can corrupt. Many act as if they are the rulers of the land but I would consider myself a servant of society. Abusing power is unthinkable to me. There are government workers who accept bribes and practice favoritism. I would treat all citizens as equals, not favoring the rich, a gender, or any particular ethnicity. This country is founded on principles of equality and should be enforced by only the fair-minded.

Professions require a certain set of skills. Applicants that want to be police officers are weeded out first for the incapable. I have astute skills to notice illegal and abnormal activities and I also have a clear sense of justice. I know I will pass the training and perform well in the field. In the not too distant future, I will assist in keeping the country, the city, the people in uniform.Prompt: ?
I was born in Guatemala. When I was about five years old my mother contacted some people and I’ve lived in Georgia ever since. Growing up was a real struggle. Bills were paid late, sometimes there was no dinner for me and my siblings, and eventually we would relocate to a different apartment. This happened several times until money was no longer an issue and we moved into a humble house.
My brother had it the worst out of the three kids my mom had. There was always the language barrier, but he was lucky since the school actually bumped him up a grade. Even with all the stress he managed to graduate. My sister was a total different story, however. Greilyn was always involved in extracurricular activities, and throughout her high school years she had at least one Advanced Placement class. She would juggle sleep, homework, sports, and after school clubs all at once. She wasn’t able to attend college because she didn’t have legal papers at that time. My brother, my sister and I were able to get a worker’s permit two years ago and my sister and brother were able to get a stable job. Both Heber and Greilyn moved to Florida, my brother with his wife and my sister with her husband.

Family problems arose back at home. When I was in seventh grade I started to miss a lot of days in school. Some teachers told me I wouldn’t get anywhere in life and that’s where I stopped caring about anything that had to deal with school. This was when life knocked the teeth straight out of my mouth. I would have mental breakdowns time after time. In the 10th grade, I barely passed the first semester and I failed four classes the second. When I got to my junior year in high school I realized how important school really was and I made a life plan to become a mechanical engineer.
I moved to Florida with my sister for the first semester of 11th grade and that’s where I recovered my lost credits. I went from taking advanced classes to standard classes in less than a year. I didn’t give up there and I’m still here standing. I know my story is merely one of thousands, but nothing would mean more to me than being the first in my family to go to college and prove to myself that I am no failure. I have always believed that one cannot get back up if they have never fallen. I’m grabbing life by the horns and taming the raging beast. This is only the beginning, for one day I will also prove the world, and those who doubted me, that I [...] am a successful college graduate.As the window bust from the hard wind I Can feel the the heat rise as the flames spread extremely rapidly from the garage to the living room. The flames started in the garage it was caused by the wires in the walls the Fire department said it was an electrical fire. I can remember the harsh smell of wood burning that made my stomach ache. The heat of the fire felt liked when you open the oven after a long time of preheating. One of My Greatest challenges that I faces was my house burning to the ground in the spring of 2007. This experience Changed my life completely it showed me things about family and friends, Showed me to Value things more, but it also made life harder.
It was 11:48Pm on a Wednesday night everybody was asleep except my brother he was up watching TV when he notice a burning smell coming from down stairs, he rushed to see where it was coming from when he notice the garage was in flames, He run upstairs panicking to wake everybody up. Once he thought everybody was up the flames was already spreading more and more. As we try and put on our shoes we hear window bursting one by one. We all rushed towards the front door were you could barely see anything because the house was filled with black smoke, as I inhaled the smoke I remember getting lite headed jumping out the fire. Then once everybody was out we notice my baby brother didn’t make it out. The fire man said it was too risky for anybody to go back in the house, even the fire marshal gave up on him. My older brother wasn’t going for it he broke loose from the fire man and ran fast thru the back yard to the back door and up the stairs as he heard my brother scream for help. He yells to my brother to just roll down the stairs. He rolls down the stairs and he and my baby brother jumped out the house together as soon as they jumped out the whole entire house collapse. My brother had 3rd degree burns in many places. They Fire department called him a miracle because they never seen somebody make it out a house like that. My family lost everything, 5 dogs all our clothes shoes furniture and pictures everything. At the end of the night we were placed in a hotel for those whom didn’t have a house. We stayed in a hotel for about 2 months until we finally moved back to Chicago for 2 months to stay with my grandma.

After the fire everything was different crying myself to sleep every night waking up in tears having nightmares of that night, I felt like I was reliving it all over again night by night, Not going to school every day because we had no clothes or shoes. When my house burnt down I left my best friend she stayed in that neighborhood she was the only person to know and understand. At that time I didn’t care about school at all. Going to school and people asking about was the worst. People making fun of me because I didn’t have a house I hated school just because of that. Nobody could understand what I was going thru at a young age. Moving from hotel to hotel school to school I went to 5 different elementary schools a different school every year. Having to make new friends every year was hard being insecure of my situation to tell people was the hardest. I used to go to school just to go not even caring about it. Until my 5th grade year and I meet this teacher who was so cooled and I could talk to her bout everything and she made me realize school is what I need. She taught me I can just write my hurt and my problems out with poetry or just start writing when I’m upset.

As time moved on things started getting better, we started getting our life back together. Started building a home back together getting everything back to normal, even though it was hard and we struggled but my mom always managed to get it done. We noticed family wasn’t always there for you when you need them. It was us by ourselves against everything all the problems with no help, even my mom mother wasn’t there after time went back. It showed us life can be gone in a blink of an eye. After that it made us stronger and closer as a family. It made us strive harder to get everything we wanted and once had because we lost it all in one night. It showed me that I need an education to be successful in order to get everything I want.Prompt: The lessons we take from failure can be fundamental to later success. Recount an incident or time when you experienced failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience?

High school is a great stepping ground for young adults to experience responsibility, freedom and to prepare themselves for college and the work field. Everyone makes mistakes but it’s up to you to correct them and better the situation.

Having responsibilities is a huge thing to have. You always have to stay focused and on top of things. My freshmen year in high school I failed second semester Biology. I didn’t know how I was going to be able to make it up so that I could still graduate on time and have a good college look at me. I went to my counselor to ask her about any programs that the school offered for kids that failed classes. She offered me a chance to do a afterschool program called Credit Recovery. The program was $100 for two weeks and class was 3 hours long. Having to do Credit Recovery for those two weeks I still had to say on top of doing my classwork for school and working. Me failing Biology set me back but also made me realize how much school Is important to me and just how badly I wanted stay focused and do the right thing.

Freedom can help or set you back in life, it’s up to you to keep everything in order and to still do what you’re supposed to do. For example wanting to go out with your friends, instead of studying for a quiz. I honestly thinkPrompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.

From a young age my grandparents were always on my butt to go in a straight line, to stay focus, and to never do something I would regret in the future. My grandparents always had a huge influence in my life. To this day I can never be any more grateful to have them. The example they set is the example I want to set to the lower classmen.

From 5 in the morning to 6 afternoons, Monday thru Friday they would come with tiredness written all over their face. Just knowing they’re busting their butts just so I can go to school and knowing I don’t have to worry about anything. Because of them I want to strive for success, I want to be someone with a doctor’s degree or a business degree, just something that they could be proud of. I was given an opportunity that wasn’t given to my grandparents and that was an education.

I’ve face situations where dropping out was the easy way out, but why quit when I’m so close to getting a diploma, why quit on something my grandparents would be so happy about, why let them down, why not graduate so they can tell their friends and family that they raised a successful kid, a kid that didn’t give up. My grandparents would tell me “ if you want to be successful go for it, we would be by your side; nothing stopping you from being someone important in life.”

It’s my senior year and its crazy to think that I made it this far, I’m the only one in my family that’s about to graduate, I’m breaking a curse that’s been in my family for generations. My grandparents are the reason for me to finish my education. Every day I would get lectured about what kind of life I would have if I don’t finish high school, I don’t want to be behind a lawn mower working 11 hours a day in the heat. Having an education open so many doors for different opportunities in the future.Prompt: Discuss the greatest challenge you have faced or expect to face

Everyone has a challenge that they expect to face. My greatest challenge that I expect to face is going to college and being successful in the future. Those are my greatest challenge because it is not going to be easy. I am going to have to put a lot of effort and not mess up. Once you mess up it is very hard to get back up, and since it is about your future than it is very important to not make that mistake.

It is not going to be easy because colleges do not just accept anybody. They require much information such as the SAT or the ACT. Which are a test that every college requires, and you have to meet the average point or above. Also a certain point of GPA and above, resume and other important requirements. College is the real thing, it is more freedom and that is where you already know what you want to do in life. You have your mind set on your career and at that moment you already know what you should do and expect to do.

To be successful in my future I have to do something I enjoy doing and that gets me good money for it. I want to do entrepreneur, because I want to have my own business. I do not like it when people boss me around. Therefor if I study entrepreneur I would be the one bossing people around and they would work for me. I enjoy that because it something I like to do and I have always wanted to have my own business. In college I want to study entrepreneur, but it would not be easy. Even though it would not be easy I would not give up, it would be a great challenge for me.

College is the time to get your things together and start working extra hard. It is not going to be easy but one should not give up. It would be extremely stressful and hard but that is just how college is. I am the type of person that gets distracted easily so I paying attention in college with no distractions would be a challenge. I would have to set up goals and learn how to accomplish each one of them. When you set up goals you have to be determined and find a way to achieve them. It is a lot to do but it is something I expect to face.Prompt: The greatest challenge I am expected to face.

As a child I had almost everything handed to me. What I would ask for I received, I had six pets for crying out loud. As time prevailed getting what I wanted when I wanted wasn’t so easy anymore. Now it’s my last year of high school and it could not be any more stressful than it is now.
It’s the last first day of high school I am struck with “senioritis” as soon as I walk through those double doors. Saying to myself “I can’t wait to graduate and get this year over with”. By May all of this will be over and I’ll be left to my own devices, by May all my friends would have moved on ,and I’ll be stuck thinking to my self what’s next? By May my time would be upPrompt: Discuss a place that has changed you.

It’s a shame how few people choose not to go to college. I plan on going to college and have a bright future. One particular school I’ve been seeking is Morehouse. I plan on attending a school with a positive environment and fair rules. I have learned unique history and facts about the school as well.

Not too long ago I visited Morehouse College my sophomore year. I was in this mentoring program called BEAMERS we went on a field trip to visit the school. This experience changed me. I remember stepping off that rusty bus into the quiet school. The halls were silent and echoed every step you took. The lunch room smelled like a 5-star restaurant. I said to myself: “I’d love to attend this school”.

As soon as we made it to the college we sat in a class room then talked to a student that attends Morehouse. He told us the GPA requirements, which was a 3.7 at the time. He explained Morehouse is a private, four-year, historically black college. We were also informed that Morehouse was an all-male school. This statement was a shock to many including myself. The crazy thing was Spelman College was right across the street from Morehouse. Spellman was an all-female school. The student informed us with much information about the school but our tour was nowhere finished.

The best part about our tour was coming up next. The student informed us with unique history of the school. There is an obelisk named in honor of Howard Thurman. Thurman was an African American author, philosopher, theologian, educator and civil rights leader. He was a graduate of Morehouse College. There were many other celebrities that graduated from this school such as Spike Lee, Samuel L. Jackson, and Martin Luther King Jr. Martin Luther King was enrolled at more at the age of 15 after skipping the 9th & 12th grade. These unique facts went on and on like a broken record.

Ever since the Morehouse tour I’ve never been the same. I met the requirements to this college. I would be more than happy to attend it. I hope ever school high school gets to tour this college. It is truly a life changing experience.Prompt: Discuss the greatest challenge you have faced or expect to face.

Throughout my entire life challenges have been with me from the beginning. No matter what I have faced challenges and been expecting to face more that are thrown my way. Without dealing with these situations in life I don’t think I would be as successful as I am now. Challenges to me are basically things to where I have to push myself in order to go where I want to go. Plus learning how to never give up and stay at the task at hand.

The greatest challenge I expect to face in life is getting my mom and brother a bigger house and a better lifestyle for them. I really expect to do all that through basketball as a matter of fact and I have a great feeling that I will be able to accomplish this as well. Basketball is really my wife in this world because I have become so phenomenal at it that I have been attending colleges and camps. The only reason for me even wanting to play is because my little brother looks up to me and he wants to see me make it big for the family. In the future as I finish up high school, I expect to have matured well enough to be ready for college and hoping that I will be succeeding in that as well. I already know that for me challenges will forever come my way but as a humble human being I will never complain. I’m going to always push myself to get better at what I love and loving something I always wanted to do.

The other challenge I expect to face is trying to find the college that’s right for me and depending on how great of a school they are education wise and activity wise. I have visited colleges any basketball or any other athlete can ever dream of. My recent visits have been North Carolina or UNC, Kentucky, Birmingham Southern, Georgia State, FAMU, Florida State University, Georgia State, Louisville, Georgia Tech, University of Georgia, and that’s pretty much it. For me visiting those schools it took a lot of hard work to get there and that’s not even including sports wise really. Those colleges expect major things from kids attending, and I can get really lazy so it will take me some time to bypass all of that. A college I was really considering going to was Florida State University. With that being a highly attended school in the country they acquire kids to be outstanding scholars. For me to get in there I have to do exceptionally well in high school as of now since I’m a senior. Because if I didn’t loiter around in my freshman and sophomore year, I wouldn’t have to worry about much as a senior. But that is a challenge I am facing at this moment and I know I can overcome it. Especially knowing people are here to support me as I continue on with the success I’m at I know I’ll be okay.

That is really the greatest challenge I have faced in my life because there were days to where I just wanted to give up and stop playing basketball all together. But I had to come to my intellectual gift and do what I what destined to do as my heart desired. Another Challenge I expect to face is overcoming my laziness and putting forth the effort as I am told to do so. But I have overcome that already but if I want to get in a successful college at this moment of life I got to just get through it. Another college I was looking forward to coming to see was Tennessee. I wanted to consider them on my list because their high school requirements aren’t as major as Kentucky and so on. But it will still be a big obstacle for me to get into. Plus their courses have to meet my needs because I wouldn’t want to attend if they aren’t as good as I thought. But there are a lot of athletes in my shoes and especially professional athletes as a matter of fact. So really it doesn’t bother me knowing I have to face a colossal obstacle at hand.Prompt: ?

I stop pull over and scream not in anguish but it in nervous excitement over my future I was going to university to some no surprise to others dis belief. My interest confused and angered my friends and some family I wanted to become a geneticist something never herd of by my pears. Growing up in Canada theirs a wall much greater than in the states not racial not nationalist theirs was a learning wall my wall from the time I could remember I had trouble with words not on the page but in my mind.

Wrestling was never a hard thing for me ya there where hard practices but its temporary it’s, better to work hard and get your hand razed then to playing around then to be on your back gasping for air. If you’ve wrestled with something, your whole life wrestling for 6 minutes is easy. So many people ask me is it hard is it hard it’s not about weather its hard it about whether it’s worth it, university is no different just another opponent I haft to wrestle agents but before we step in the ring I’m just letting you know university compared to my previous opponents is just a bump in the high way of life.Prompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.

My parents are the ones that have made me who I am. They are the reason to why I am in school. Thanks to them I want to do my best and become someone in life. Each one of them had their own part in order for me and my brother to get here.

My mom, she has worked really hard since the time she got here in order to bring my older brother and me here. She has always given us what we wanted and works hard for it. She has two jobs morning and afternoon. She leaves at 7am and comes home at 11pm from her second job. Sometimes my brothers and I don’t see her the whole day. We would have to say up in order to see her and when she has off.

She tries to hang out with us When she doesn’t work she would take us to the park or anywhere we want. Somehow she always finds a way to spend time with us even though she might be tired. She did her best for me now it’s my turn to do my best for her and give her the life she deserves. Furthermore my father has always been there for us and gives us what we need.

My father on the other hand has only one job. He works in the morning and comes home at 4pm. Somehow he finds a way to pay bills send money to my family In Mexico and have some left to give to us so we can buy what we want. He would give us advice to keep moving forward to not give up and to go for our dreams. All my father wants is for us to be happy and get education. He wasn’t given the opportunity to go to school and be someone in life, but even though he didn’t go to school he is very smart. Now it’s up to me to give them the life they deserve.

Being a little kid sounds good and joyful. Mostly all kids have a good childhood and some not so many that good. People like seeing little kids laugh, smile, giggle, and play. I wished I had a childhood like that it would off change me. I would enjoy my years but I couldn’t because I had responsibilities when I was a little kid.
When I was a little kid I had to look out for my little brother. I had to help out my mom around the house and help here clean houses so we can get money and pay the bills and for food. Also on top of anything my dad left us or abandoned us when I was 8 years old. When I was 10 I had to work in a job so I can help out my mom,Prompt: A Personal or national issue that is important to you
The distribution of wealth in America is one of the biggest issues to me on a personal level and is a big problem on a national level too. Economic equality doesn’t seem like a priority in this country with the lopsided balance of wealth in this country. Surveys have been done interviewing Americans of all different backgrounds and economic status and most thought that the distribution of wealth in America was a lot closer than in reality what it is. There are a lot of people in America struggling, out of work and not meeting their financial needs and that I see as a big problem because, the situation could be handled better to where everyone can benefit.
Now I can’t ever see Americas wealth being distributed equally because, there would be no drive to work and achieve goals and make more money. I do believe that the gap between how much the wealthy, the middle class and poor people make is way too wide. 40 % of this nation’s wealth go to the top 1%. That means those big C.E.O‘s guys like bill gates 40% of the whole nations wealth goes to those guys. The average these guys get paid is 380x more than there average employee and in the fast food industries over 1200x more. Now I’m sure that’s these guys work very hard for their money but its very hard to believe that they are working 1200x or even 380x harder than their employees. Also the richest 20% of Americans own 84% of the nation wealth.
There are so many people on food stamps and other government assistance programs because, of this problems. You have people with degrees and can’t find jobs that pay well enough to provide for their families and daily lifestyle. There are millions in this country who struggle to make ends meet financially and very few rich people, but yet the ratio of how much they make versus millions of Americans is ridiculous.

There is also a big reason why the rich make so much more money than the poor. Normally poor people are unaware of this situation and just trying to get by in life. The poor and middle class a lot of times do not educate themselves to this situation and it seems as the rich care more because, they want to keep all the money there making. If we want to make money and solve this problem we have to wake up and realize what’s actually going on with our wages and demand a better distribution of the wealth in this country.Prompt: ?

A good lawyer can the be the biggest factor in a case. A great example that many people have heard was is the o.j. Simpson case. Many people thought that he commit the crimes. Most of the proof connected to the crime he was accused did point to him, however Simpson brought the bet lawyers money could buy. With his lawyers he was found not guilty which surprised many people. I personally do not care if Simpson was or was not guilty however his case did teach me the importance of a good lawyer.
When I was a boy my brother was arrested for murder, later they found the real killer but he spent two years on the inside. When I found out he was guilty I felt tears falling my face. My family could not afford a very good lawyer and we had to use a family friend, Joe Vincent. My mother said that Vincent was an okay lawyer but the prosecutor was like Peitho, the Greek god of persuasion. My mom would not let me attend the trail (she thought it would be inappropriate for a seven year old.) I had to grind my teeth or I would yell at the top of my lungs. When my brother was convicted many of my own family members believed he was guilty. That reinforced my belief that a lawyer has the power to win any case. That’s why I want to be lawyer to make sure the right people are convicted.

If a lawyer is good enough he can be the main factor in a case. Even with all the evidence stacked, like the Simpson case, a lawyer can still win your case. A convince judge or jury that a man is guilty or innocent, that is why I want to be a lawyer. After the I read about the Simpson case I a light off went in my head, I saw that could help a lot people by just being their lawyer. I know now that there is a lot to being a lawyer but I still want to help people by being their lawyer.

Something else I found out about lawyer is that many people could not afford the good ones. I plan on doing a lot of pro bono work. I want to help everyone I believe to be innocent. Many people who cannot afford a good lawyer and are found guilty and have a harsher punishment, however people of considerable wealth usually get off quite easy because the can afford amazing lawyers. There are many examples of the rich getting off easy besides the Simpson case. Walmart is sued every for some another but they can afford the best lawyers alive. I believe many big companies can sell harmful food or underpay their employees not because they bribe government officials but because they get the best lawyers they can buy to convince the government that everything is fine.

Those reasons I not only want to be a lawyer but I want to start my own firm, because many lawyers abuse their powers of persuasion for money. My firm will be about help people who can’t afford a good lawyer and of course those who can because I need to make a living. I will try to be the best lawyer I can be so no one has to watch their innocent brother go to jail.Prompt: Greatest challenge I have faced

Having to grow up looking different than other can be difficult especially when your overweight .you get looked at differently , judged differently , and treated differently and this has been my greatest challenge faced so far .

What do you think of when you hear of something that weighs 224 pounds? Big and heavy right? Well that was me, a big 14 year old girl with low self-esteem. Everywhere I went I was looked at differently than others. I didn’t even want to leave my room because even my family looked at me differently with eyes looking straight at me up and down with disgust and disappointment knowing that I could do better , but I didn’t care I ate and ate whatever I desired I don’t even know what I ate most of the time because the more they looked at me like that the more I wanted to eat but then I realized I was getting bigger and unhealthy so I ate less and it was a nightmare but then I started noticing results but it still wasn’t enough but I didn’t give up on myself .

As time passed by I was being judged because I was still over weight. People called me fat, ugly and people made fun of me in every possible way they could. I was embarrassed of myself I was even made fun of for trying to lose weight and everything I ate I didn’t know what to do that I would just cry to sleep but I kept telling myself hard work will pay off and people will see that they were wrong to bully some overweight girl because I will shine .

As I got older I started having more friends and they were all thinner than me and every time we went out together all the boy would have their eyes on them but me .I knew is was because of my weight cus no guy likes big girls well at least that’s what thought and all I had on my mind is that why don’t they look at me like that? , why don’t they think im cute ? so I lost more weight .Prompt: Who has influence me the most

Every time I think of my first day of sophomore year I can picture it in my head like if I am living in the moment. That night I had to go to bed, my eyes were opened as wide as three school buses put together because I could not sleep from how excited I was to go to school. I kept reaching under my pillow for a little white iPhone 4s -that barely functioned just to glance at the time. It was barely twelve or twelve –twenty around that time. I was so anxious to meet new people eat lunch with friends and just the feeling of arriving as a sophomore made it tough for me to fall asleep. I had no Idea I was going to meet someone that will make a difference in me and the way of seeing things in life. You never know who will influence you for good or bad.

It was a brand new year at my high school. Everyone is excited well, almost everyone. As I walked in the building I saw Amanda, one of my classmates from last year. We never really talked it was a Hi and bye kind of thing but this time she was more excited to see me than ever. I could tell by the way she approached me and yelled my name out across the halls. I guess you could say she was lonely and didn’t want to roam the school alone on the first day. I didn’t mind at all because I was alone too. I pulled out a crumpled piece of paper that contained my schedule and I started to scan the routine I had to take. As I placed my schedule back she asked me what I had for first period. “I have French first what about you?” I responded. I recall the smile she carried on her face when she said, “OMG I do too!” We both pulled out our schedules to compare them and it turned out that not only did we have first period together but, we had each other in all classes.

Never did it cross my mind that Amanda and I would have classes together.Prompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.

I Know like every college essay, people talk about their mom being their hero, but in my case I truly believe my mom is my hero. My mom has faced many challenges in her life and she always makes it work out to her benefit. I watched my mother struggle with 3 jobs, she worked in Columbia University in the human resources department, she worked as a mom, and she was my teacher. Even to this day no challenge stops her from reaching her goal, I am glad to say in 2016 like me she will be graduating but she will be getting her bachelors’ degree.

When I started the second grade things started to become hectic because I was always getting in trouble at home and my mom being a young mother didn’t know I had a hereditary learning challenge where I have a difficult time hearing and pulling phonetic sounds. She thought I was being lazy and would make me stay up late on school nights to finish my homework. Years later we discovered that my brother came out with the same hereditary reading challenge, we also discovered that the gene was given to me and my brother through my dad who had gotten it from his mother.

My mother wasn’t always the happiest or patience woman, my dad expected a lot from her and so did we. She was our mom, a co-worker, a wife, a teacher, and a chef. A lot of her responsibilities became mine when I entered 6th grade. I was responsible for leaving for school at 8:05, after school going straight to karate class, at 6 o’clock leaving karate to go pick up my brother and sister from afterschool and taking them home so they can start on their homework and I had to help them with their homework too. When I entered the 7th grade I told my mom that it was a lot of pressure to go to school karate and pick up the kids on time to get them home, so she placed me in the same after school program so right after they release me I can get my brother and sister and take them home. Things soon became very complicated when the girls at my school wanted to fight me and would chase me home every day after school. So my mother had to lie and say we lived with my aunt so I can go to the same school as her kids. So my mother would drive me to school every day right before she left for work and I would have to take the bus home to get to my afterschool. When my mother got home at 6:30 she would say hi to us and go straight to the kitchen to cook dinner. MY dad expected dinner to be done when he got home because he worked 2 jobs. My mother did all the parenting because my dad was always tired and sleepy when he got home so she had to do a lot of the disciplining herself. Sometimes her choices weren’t the best but she did the best she could.Prompt: Describe an important transition in your life

Imagine waking up one morning to the bitter sound of nothing. You’re the last to wake up but that could’ve fooled anyone with the amount of silence flowing throughout the entire house. I remember walking downstairs to the kitchen on June 3rd 2015, and seeing my family gathered around the dinner table. Without them even saying a word I already knew what was coming next. I mentally prepared myself for what I was about to hear but there’s not enough ways in the world to prepare yourself to hear that your home isn’t going to be your home anymore.

After 15 years of living in the same house and learning this place like the back of my hand and watching as what was once the little tree outside our house grow every day, or watching the progression of the fresh black concrete fade as the days went by to a dry grey color, after all of that; this house wasn’t going to be ours anymore. This was the same house I learned to ride a bike at, where I met my best friend the first day we moved here from Texas when I was only 3 years old, where I had my birthday parties, where I experienced the most important milestones in my life; letting go seemed more than impossible. Moving day came and I watched as each room in our house became empty; it was almost as if we were never there.

It was an emotional roller coaster. Although a part of me was hurt I had to push my feelings to the side and be a support system for my parents. I did not let them know how I was feeling about the whole situation and just tried my best to uplift their spirits. I didn’t want them to feel in anyway guilty because I knew well that everything was done that could have possibly been done to try to keep our home. I was grateful to them because although we were in a tight situation money wise they pushed every penny they had and still managed to give our family a nice house to live in. it’s a beautiful place really it’s a town house, 2 story, wood floors with white rooms. The first time I walked into this house I felt like crying because I knew there was no going back to my old house. After nights of crying and missing my old home, I realized change should always be good. No matter how difficult the situation might be, or how “impossible” letting go may seem to you at the moment you always have to make sure that you use your time wisely. That’s exactly what I did. This situation might not seem like the most tragic thing in the world, and that’s because it’s not. This transition alone though ,has taught me to enjoy every second of what I have while I have it because you never know if the next day you’ll wake up and it won’t be there for you anymore.

I learned to take advantage of my time because you can never go back. This is a lesson everyone should learn in their lifetime, I know it’s a cliché thing to say but I never really found the true meaning of this until I experienced it firsthand. Time is everything and sometimes you don’t get warnings as to when it will be gone. I’ve lived by this everyday but never really embraced it like I do now. You need to enjoy everything till the last bit of it. Losing my house was an awful point in time for our family, but we learned quickly from this. This happening made us learn to value everything in our lives to a further extent. This was a lesson well learned and well needed.Sixth PeriodPrompt: The greatest challenge that I expect to face

Ok, so since I’m talking about my greatest challenge I thought about it, but I realized I cannot think of one. So I decided to just write about the challenge that I am facing now in my senior year of high school. So really this is the greatest challenge I have ever faced. So come with me in this challenge and image what I’m going through.
So one day my consoler had called me in to his office and had showed me what my credits were. So I saw it and I wondered and thought to myself. Am I really going to graduate with my senior class in May 2016? But first for me to do that, I need to go through some steps in order to graduate. And believe me it’s a lot of steps. So the things I need to do are mandatory.

So what I need to do is? 1. Pass all the classes I have this semester and next semester. 2. I have to do credit recovery this semester and next semester. 3. Do 2 classes online or from a different place like faith academy, phoenix, and a different place that which I forgot. 4. Pass all of those in those classes and then I need 1.5 credits of the following: Arts, foreign language, or technology class outside of Berkmar. And this is a lot to do on my part, And not to mention a lot of money for all that. So this year I really got to step up my game a lot on my grades. If I want to pass and graduate next year may.
This right here had got put to the top of this list of challenges. But anyway let me continue on this. When I had got home and told my mom and dad what I needed to do. We started looking up what I can do and how much everything is going to be and everything. I can tell u right now it’s not going to be cheap at all. When I was talking to my consoler, and he was telling me a lot of things I need to do. His face didn’t look like a good one. He told me that it would be a lot of work for me and was telling me to just finish it next year in December. And he was saying that it won’t be cheap because of where I had to take it. So I said ok and that I was going to go ahead and try it.

The reason y this is a big challenge for me is because of what my consoler said when I had left his office. He said and I quote that it was going to be hard and he told me that it’s not impossible but he didn’t say it was possible. So when he said that I said to myself this is a big challenge for me do I accept? And in my head I said yes I do challenge accepted. So now this will be the biggest challenge I have ever faced. Now let me see if I can compete this challenge or is it going to be a fail? Never know till I try.Prompt: You have been elected President of the United States; write your inauguration speech for us.

Greetings, my fellow Americans of the United States of America. As your new President, I would like to share my feelings and changes I have in mind to put our country in a positive direction. But, before anything, I would like to thank the citizens of America for making me their new President and giving me a chance to better our country.

First, I have a speech for you America, a speech to demonstrate my options, or plans for this country of ours. Let’s all face it; America is heading upside down, Economy/National issues. Our war on isis has been going on for a bit now, and our previous president has done NOTHING to get us out of the situation, instead he used his 2 cents and made things worse. But , my goal on the other hand , is to bring our troops home and end the conflict with isis , simply by destroying them , talk is cheap , serious action needs to be done, quickly. Now , promises have failed this country so now I will say , America, I will give you my word , isis will no longer be an issue for the United States.

Secondly, I would like to address the welfare problem; it has completely gotten out of hand. Most people on welfare get money every month, without even giving an attempt to get a job or make something of themselves. It’s nice to know where my tax dollars are going, along with many other Americans. But now that I’m in office that will change. The welfare policy will be if you sign up for welfare and you don’t have a job currently, you have 4 months to find a job and be accepted or else if you don’t complete the task, you wouldn’t be qualified for welfare and have to wait 1 year before you can try again. You only get $100 for groceries, every month, which should be great because you will have a job if you’re on welfare.

Lastly, I would like to address the complication of cops, and how some people have their opinion that police officers are to overpowered and they are serving brutality to African Americans. Police officers do their job; they risk their lives to save others. If you’re not in the situation first hand , dealing with the subject , you have no right to share your 2 cents on what you think the cop is doing, because when it all comes down to it , you will need them before they need you. So with that being said I will change the law to where, if you fail to cooperate and listen to the cop by the first instruction, you simply need to be taken in , because you failed to listen and follow direction , and it would be a fine for Failure to follow instructions.

In conclusion, America I’m here to create a brighter future for everything and everyone. But most importantly make a brighter future for our country, The United States of America. With that being said , expect bigger and better things , thank you for electing me as your President.Prompt: ?

Challenges can be helpful or they can be stressful. Either a good stress that motivates you to do your very best or the bad kind that can lead to health problems and bring you down. Either way it goes, challenges help us, regardless if we like what the challenges is. My greatest challenge is happening right now, deciding what college to go to.

There are many different colleges that I can apply to. Most of the schools, I don’t even know the name or where they are located. I want to be a high school art teacher. Meaning I most have 4 years of with a major in education and art as my minor. I originally thought that it that art would be my major and education would be my minor. I was born in Missouri, so it would be good to find colleges there, because I already know the area. Atlanta is my second choose, it is where I am currently living and where I most likely be living for another year.

There are two school that interested me Slayer University and Kaplan U. Slayer has class that I would have to go to, but Kaplan u has online classes which is way more convenient for me saying that I am no actually in Missouri at the moment. Although, I might miss out on the experience of campus life, online classes seem a lot less of a hassle. Now that I have chosen the schools that I am most interested in I have to make a plan of action. I must first look at the requirements and see if I meet them. Then I must make sure I have a place to stay for which ever school I end up going to whether with family, a dorm with a roommate, or even an apartment. Either way it goes I will need to get a job that will allow me to study and attend classes.

Another challenge that would go along with this is that Georgia and Missouri are very different places. In Georgia I feel like a car is a most have thing most of the stores and restaurants are miles away. When I lived in Missouri, I and my friends walked to almost every store and restaurants, the stores were never further then 1-2 miles away from where I lived it was great and we never wasted gas. In Missouri it’s in the north meaning it snows. I used to roll in the snow as a child and December was that happiest month for me because I love when the temperature is below 20 degrees. In Georgia I hate it, here it never snows and the temperature doesn’t even go below 40 degrees. It’s too hot here; if I do end up going to a college in Georgia it will have been my last possible option.

My greatest challenge was deciding what college to go to. Now that I have looked at the pros and the cons, moving to Missouri or staying here in Georgia I decided that Missouri is where I belong. Having already lived there for most of my life and having family close by it would also be the smart choose. Yes Georgia has its pros, but the cons over way them. This challenge has affected my life in a good way. I the way that it made me think about what I want to do with my life after high school it gave me another challenge. That is to get in the college that I want to go to.Prompt: The Person Who Inspired Me The Most

The women who took care of me for 17 years always told me, “Do something that you love and not something for the love of money.” My mom has been and always will be my number one supporter. She was the person who encouraged me to be comfortable in expressing myself. She was the one who wanted me to strive to be someone that I would be happy about 5 years down the road. My mom is the reason I’m going for this. I always knew cosmetology was something I loved and wanted to do for a very long time.

I can remember the first time I started wearing makeup. I woke up one morning feeling bold and snuck in one of my mom’s mascaras out her purse that felt like a never-ending cave. Being only in 5th grade, I had no idea what I was doing. I’ve seen my mom put on her bright lipstick and her neutral eye shadow colors with peachy cheeks before and it just excited me about wanting to be exactly like her. I was terrified that my mom would catch me, but I honestly couldn’t wait to ask her. I only finished putting mascara on one eye and left to school like that.

Throughout the years, I went through some pretty bad embarrassments. My first year of middle school I decided I needed a new me, a new haircut. I chopped off my hair. My nest of hair looked like I closed my eyes and sneezed when I cut it. My seventh year wasn’t any better. I used to watch a lot of videos on the internet. So I decided to experiment on picture day. I see these girls on TV that made any eye color look just absolutely stunning. I wanted to do what they did. I remember wearing this flamingo bright pink on my eyes with some lipstick that looked like a basket of red apples. I don’t know how I survived school. All those years and my mom always told me that practice makes perfect.

As I grew older and my mind-set changed, wanting to be a cosmetologist never did. While everyone wanted to be a doctor, computer expert, or even a zoo keeper, I wanted to dedicate my life on making other people feel good about themselves. I’ve been told that a cosmetologist isn’t a job a hundred times that at some point I started to believe them. My mom is the one who said, “If it makes money, it’s a job.” My passion for hair and beauty is unbelievable. I made sure I got ahead on my high school credits to attend Maxwell and start early. My goal one day after high school and later finishing up cosmetology school is to open up a business over in Texas. I know I’m setting the bar high on this one but I’m going to for it and I’m sticking to this. My mom encouraged me to do this and make it happen at whatever risk. She’s all the support I need to make this happen.

My mom wants me to aim high but walk through stairs. Applying to Paul Mitchell School is the first step on my staircase. Being accepted to this school would be an honor and privilege to attend to. This school is everything I want. Paul Mitchell is every future cosmetologist dream. The challenges I would have to face are going to be worth every sweat and tear being a student here. This is where I set foot outside of my box. Through this school, I will be become the person I’ve long waited to be and I know my mom would be so proud to call me her daughter.Prompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.

Role models, we all them or at least someone we look up too weather that person is real or fictional. Personally speaking I have several role models but the main one that I can say has had the biggest influence on me is batman. “Yes batman” the dark night himself. Going back I remember watching the old series batman and just thinking he was (in simplest terms) awesome! Since then he was already a part of my life but it wasn’t until the beginnings of middle school when he really impacted me. To begin with, I wasn’t a very social person most throughout my life. More or less due to the fact that I had terrible self-esteem because of previous encounters with bulling in elementary school. To worsen things I was already a naturally shy person and my face would always turn tomato red and my palms would start to get moist every time I would get called on to answer a question or even do something simple like walking to talk to the teacher. As years passed by things got worse and they weren’t looking any better as time passed. Thus watching my entire favorite hero’s on TV and such I really got into the character batman. This is because of the entire hero’s that would pass on TV, they all were likable friendly extrovert kinds of people and batman was the complete opposite. He was quite, serious; he wouldn’t play and had no friends, in addition to the fact that even some civilians (the people he protects) fear him. All that though didn’t bother batman. He would still carry his duty and protect the people regardless of anything. So eventually what started to happen was that I found myself relating to batman’s person or character. In doing so, it made things start looking up for me. How? Because I could now be myself and not feel completely down about the way I was. If batman could be serious and scary to people but yet a hero at the same time, why not I.” maybe not a hero” but at least out there handling my business without caring what people think. Anyways as the years started to pass I would just feel better and better about myself. It got to the point that it would show through my character, personality, voice; just everything that I was indeed feeling more comfortable with myself. So By the time of high school I was a different person. I was more out spoken, people would approach me and not say that were scared of me or such. Everything was going great but then things took a slight turn. Those kids that I had problems with bulling in elementary school were going to BHS as well. Everything was still all well until I would see them or they would have the same class as me. I would just feel a huge explosion go off in my chest and my head got really hot and my mood would just change for the worst in a second. The reason for that was that I couldn’t forgive them for what they had done to me previously. This experience or event however let me to be able to relate to batman a little more in the sense of forgiveness. To begin with, watching batman I noticed that no matter what any villain did or how corrupt and psycho that person was, he never once hurt an enemy to the point that they were in the hospital or anything. Instead he would warn them before he did anything and if they didn’t listen then he would take action. From all that though, what I took in was that he forgave the bad for himself to be the better person and not give into a bad path where he would end up being the same or no better than the people he fights against. Thus I admired that and decided to forgive all my enemies and such and just be the bigger person and carry on with my life. In doing so I was able to finish high school and carry on with the world and with ease all thanks to my number one hero/idol batman.Literally I feel like my heart just dropped to the floor and I am terrified to pick it back up. My eyes were locked at the end of the board all I had to do now was to take my steps and do my dive. Every step I took I felt like the board was getting longer and longer and I wouldn’t be able to reach it but at last I was at the end and you better believe I was riding that board like it was my life on the line. Shooting me off like a cannon ball I majestically did my dive and I went into the water like a fish causing no splash at all.

Being in the water felt really peaceful like if it was another world I could hear people clapping and chanting like animals fighting over a piece of meat as I arose to the surface I could hear the scoring from the judges overall they thought it was a good dive. Coming out of the water knowing that I was done competing felt great my heart was no longer on that board it was right back in my rib cage. Considering that it was my first meet I thought I did pretty good looking at my team from a far I could see them jumping up and down and cheering. Getting closer and closer to them made my smile stretch all the way up to the ends of my ears I was extremely happy because knowing that I made them proud gave me great joy in seeing them. Arriving to the bench where my team was stationed at felt like I was arriving to home from a long trip.
Minutes after I had taken a seat to rest and to think about overall on how did I began to realize that I had come so far to be at this level. A short woman with big ol’ white hair had started to rally up a commotion about me to my coaches. Suddenly I felt a pounding on my shoulder coming from someone wanting my attention I slowly turned around to acknowledge the person and it turned out to be the women with big ol’ hair. Looking at me with her big eyes I knew she had some news to tell me and it was good news.Prompt: ?

The past mistakes make you rethink your choices and decisions to better yourself. “Life does not get better by chance, it gets better by change.” My life has been impacted in many ways as I grew up starting when I was 5 years old and barely came to the United States in the year of 2004. I thought my life would be such a hurricane due to what had happened in my family especially with my own mother and led to changing the way of living with my brother. Family is very important in our daily life. Family supports you on anything, loves you regardless how much someone can fail them and family are people that are always there for you helping you with important things such as your education or deciding what type of pathway you will choose when going into college. People in the world do not realize how much impact they can cause into someone’s life either for better or for bad such as falling into depression or finding better ways to make them even better as a person.

Fairy tales don’t exist maybe in movies and shows but not in real life where many broken pieces with unanswered questions will be found, unfortunately some stories don’t end with a “happily ever after”. A couple of months had passed by since I arrived from Mexico to Georgia. A lot of changes were going on in my family, one started with my mother who was being strange all the time, who at times made her own kids feel like the only mother they had was their grandmother and aunts. A few days passed away, my brother and I were playing outside until we saw our mother walking by with a bag that was full of her and my little sister’s clothes. She had told us that she was going to sale those clothes or donate them but who could of thought what she said was all a lie. Days and a couple of months went by no type of communication was involved after my mom left with my little sister, until it was my little cousins birthday party was when I finally got to see my little sister and this time would be for forever. Someone I did not see was my mom.

Years have come by and there was no communication done with her. Almost 15 years have come by with no word being heard from the person that gave me birth, I forgot who my mother is, how she looks like and her way of being. All I remember was that I had a mother who just didn’t care about hurting her own kids or leaving them without thinking about how much they will end up needing her throughout the years. During those 15 years of life for 3 years I fell into depression where all I wanted to do was commit suicide simply because seeing my friends with both their parents made me jealous and feel worthless. I always dreamed of having perfect parents who would last forever and be an example for their own kids. Fairy tales don’t end with happy ending sometimes you have to create your own beginning by having people that will help you and never give up on you and end up with a happy ending.
The years continued to go on until I was 10 years old. My brother was going into his last year of high school unfortunately my family was breaking apart economically. My father had it very tough with my siblings, grandma and I. He had two jobs in which he got paid well but that money wasn’t enough for the bills that needed to be paid.Prompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.

Did you ever had that feeling when you’re hopeless? Or that moment when you just want to give up? Or that feeling when you’re stuck and don’t know how to get out of the situation? I had, a ton and I feel like I’m the only one with problems. That’s when I need help but like friends aren’t always there. My sister Elsy has helped me time to time and gave me advice even though I don’t do what she tells me what I should do in my own problems.

My sister Elsy, loves to create pictures on paper. She also influence me on “Not giving up” and “There’s more than one way.” Whenever I need advice, she’s the one that can give a hand. She even has her bad situations of her own, when she draws. Elsy makes an image on a paper, yet it doesn’t seem right to her, so she keeps on trying till she gets it right. Then there’s me, I doutle something and it comes out awful, so I do what Elsy did. I keep on tryin’ till I get it right.

Elsy also helps me when there’s a boy problem, in relationship, sometimes I need help on what to do. The feeling when I was being a toy and my feelings didn’t have meaning. There’s problems everyday and it never quits. Elsy tells me to drop it and go to the next one or better to stay single. She was right and I realized I needed to think of myself first and for what is best for me. I give people advice, yet I don’t know why I don’t take my own advice.

Elsy also influence me on planning for my future after graduation. My sister has a big future ahead of her and she knows where her place is at. It made me think,What am i going to do after graduation? Which college am i going to go? Where am I going to be in the future? Of course Elsy lend a helping hand and step by step my plans grew. I would go to college and learn fashion arts or music. After college I head off to country to country and with my career, I express it. Soon I would settle in a very wealthy house with new members.

Even though Elsy is younger than me she is a big influence for me. Her life was like a shadow being behind me between middle school and high school, that is how she understands what I’m going through. She knows what is best for me “I’m telling you this Sandy because I don’t want you to end up in the garbage out in the world.” We act like cats and dogs time to time and I hate it when Elsy acts like a parent. But Elsy had helped me through rocky times. I love the fact that she’s my sister and I can always count on her when I need a hand.Prompt: ?

Donald Trump wants to beat everyone in poles but where does he really stand in the economy? Lately all he has been arguing about is immigration insisting that Mexican immigrants were “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs, they’re bringing crime, they’re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.” and arguing Mexican immigrants bring “tremendous infectious disease” to the country, which is not true, not just that but treating tariffs because he is “rich” as he claims in CNN news. “I’m rich and not using lobbyists. I’m not using donors. I don’t care I’m rich” and expects us to believe that he’s really going to makes U.S.A a better place when he plans to hurt people and family’s and doesn’t care about other races other than the legal people whom according to him do not make crimes or are not spreading diseases

As many people have heard Donald Trump is working with Univision as head management in miss U.S.A pageant. as soon as this 20015 pageant ends he claims that he is not satisfied because of a “non-completed agreement in his contract.” When in reality he is just trying to make an honest buck out of Univision that happened to be the biggest Hispanic news industry and the TNT network news interview him and ask him “do you regret the comments ?” Donald Trump: “”Not at all had I said people from all over the country” TNT network: “how much are you sewing them for?” Donald Trump: “I’m sewing them for a tremendous amount of money for defamation” when really the person who should be sewed for defamation is him for saying people from the middle east and Islamic people are destroying our countryPrompt: Evaluate a significant experience of achievement that has special meanings to you.

It would be best if you started thinking about your future nobody knows where you are going to be in the future so it is the great thing to start thinking. It would be great if I achieve my achievement that I always have been achieving for. And it is to start a business of my own to have a better career in the future but in order for that I need to have education also a lot of money to build the business that I am trying to build because it will need a lot of equipment that is necessary for the business. So I going to try to build up as fast I could to make some money for me and to have my own house also I would like to graduate from high school because I’m trying to be the first member of my entire family to graduate from high school. It has so much meaning to me because ever since I saw my brother dropout I was thought that I going to the first to get a high school diploma to have a better job than my brothers, I would like to buy a new house for my family. In order for me to get there I need to get the all education I need in school but is going to worthy it because it will help me in the future with other jobs or working company of hand works so it won’t be difficult for me in the future when I need to do those types of things with self in company or jobs. One day I was doing hands work in the job to clean up the mess that they have made there but it was so messily that I will need some people to help me in the back.Prompt: Discussing the greatest challenge I have faced and expected to face.

I read a quote before; the quote said “It might take a year, it might take a day, but what’s meant to be will always find its way.” It had an unknown writer, but that don’t mean the worlds where not powerful. What do this quote means to me is that life is a challenge. In which it is, but that don’t mean you can’t get passed that challenge. My biggest challenge is my IEP. What does IEP means to me; well I should say what it did mean to me. IEP means to me is a small problem in life that I have struggled with for a long time. The real meaning is “(IEP) — to help kids succeed in school”. I have an IEP in reading, math and writing.

I would say reading is my biggest one, it not that I can read it just means I struggle with that the most. I have the biggest fear that one day I would just get called out in front a whole bunch of people and be told to read something. People are my biggest fear when you say something or something they would laugh. When I am by myself when I read for miles, it seems I forget all the worlds when I’m around people. I have been getting better though, I read more and also out loud.

Math is the easy for me; I can do it with flying colors if I know what I’m doing. For math all I have to do is listen to the teacher and ask questions. Really math isIndicate a person who has had a significant influence on you can describe that influence.

Role models are people you look up to and admire. They can be celebrities, family members, or a friend. They can also influence you through many ways like maybe through a song or a picture .Their influence can either be positive or negative. My mother has influenced me to be hardworking, supportive, and positive.
My mother has influenced me to be hardworking, because she started working at a young age, she has her own business, and she started from the bottom. My mother started working at the age of 13 in Mexico, and she was taken out of school. She practically was the only person bringing home the money, because her parents didn’t work enough to support the family. This made me realize that working hard in school pays off, because not everyone has the same opportunities in other countries. My mother owning her own business influences me to strive to own my own business someday and be the best I can be. She is her own boss and doesn’t have to worry about someone else constantly being over her. Also she started from the lowest point to building her way to the top. This shows me that it doesn’t matter where you come from or who you are you have the potential to be a somebody and not be nobody.

My mother has influenced me to be positive, because you are able to see a different outlook on life and many doors open for you. My mom has gotten to where she is today by staying positive, no matter how bad a certain situation got or if she was going through a tough time; She always looked on the bright side. She would always overcome that certain obstacle. This taught me that no matter what obstacle I face, I will overcome it. Also staying positive can lead to opening new doors for me, because mom has had many doors open for her. She started working for the first time when I was 8, and she would get mean comments from her coworkers .She didn’t allow that to affect her instead she stayed positive, and she soon started to get more and more opportunities. She was able to buy the store she was once an employee at, all because she was positive and kept her cool throughout the time she was working there. This has made have a different point of view on things and not to hold grudges towards other people.

My mother has influenced me to be very supportive of myself and others, because being supportive towards other people can really show others what’s important to you, and what you care about. My mom has been very supportive about my plans and goals for the future. She has sat down with me and asked me about my future plans, and she listens to what I have to say. She also gives me advice on how I shouldn’t be to insecure on what other people say about me and always do my best at whatever it is. This has really taught me that I am really fortunate to have a mom who supports me, because not everyone is fortunate to have parents who support you on your plans after high school.

In all, my mom has been the person I admire the most; she has influenced me in many ways the words can’t explain. She has taught me that it is important to be hardworking, because hard work pays off. Also that having a positive mind set can lead to new opportunities. Also that having support in your life can help you .Prompt: Discuss what makes you uniquely qualified for this position.

The reason why I should work at Footlocker or any other shoe company, because I have the potential for working with shoes, and Im also an excellent shoes salesman. I really want this job, because I can finally help support my mom pay some bills and help my family with the rent, and also make her proud. To be honest I really think that working at footlocker is going to be an easy task to do because once a customer walks in the store imam greet them with respect and let them find some shoes that they are looking for, and if I see them struggle then imam walk up to them and ask them if they need any help or any shoes that they are looking at in particular.
There are going to be some strengths and weakness that I’m going to have when I work there, and my strengths are greeting the customers with a smile, asking them if they need any help, going to the back room and going to get their shoe size and then going to the register and ringing them up correctly. My weakness are knowing the type of shoes that they want that will be comfortable for them and also seeing which shoe will be in style for kids and adults, but I can manage to get to that by researching online and looking them up to get real comfortable with hooking them up with shoes. I feel like that I can be way better than the other workers that I’m going to be working with because once a customer comes in and ask one of my co-worker that they are looking for some shoes that they can play basketball in and then they’re going to be like I don’t know what you’re talking about, then that is when I come in and be like I know the perfect shoes that can be fit for you when you play basketball, then I walk over to that section and show them and then they are going to say hey I like these, then I ring them up and tell them to have a nice day and come back and see us again. Another reason is that I’m very organized and very nice when it comes to talking to people and I’m also very friendly, for example if you come up to me and ask me a question I am going to say sure I can help you with something and then walk over there and see what the customer needs help with and then once they ask me that they need a shoe measure, I’m going to go and get the thing to measure their foot to see what size I need to get.Prompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.
Is there a person who significant influence on you. Like your parent, your friend, and your cousin. What makes you unique person you are today. The person takes you places you like to go. Who makes you happy when you are in a bad day?
There is a person I significant influence. That is my dad. He do is best for us, have insurance, makes go to school and buy us food. My dad tells me what is right and wrong. Each day if we do something wrong he would repeat the things over and over again in a good way.

We love him anyway he does. He takes the places you like to go. I wanted to go to the mall or the book store. My dad was doing something he was watching a soccer games, he said to wait for the break time. He will drive you there. I have a sister we always fright, so my dad would say when you get order you won’t have each other backs and regret what you have back then.

My dad would always tell us a story when he was small. Each time we talk during dinner time he would about his stories. He would say your parent can’t stay with you; you have to do it on your own. When we have some kind of party, he doesn’t like other people talk about his family like that. There are some people doesn’t like us. Most of the party we go there are my mom she has a lot of friends. He always asks us about our day. He always asks us about our day. When we get home from school he would say that to us. My dad wants me a good life, not like my parent right now. My dad work at a Mayer Electric Suppler, my mom work at a nail place each day is like that. My dad doesn’t want us like them. He would want us always to go to school.Seventh PeriodPrompt: Think of a place you know well. Describe the place, and include your feelings about it.

Home; there’s no place like it. It’s my favorite place to be but also the place I loathe the most. The 13 years that I have lived in my house there have been so many memories made with my family and friends. Memories full of nonsense and memories full of love and fun.
All the foolishness and nonsense began when I moved from an apartment, into the house I live in now. I was only 4 when Daniel moved in the big blue house next to mine. Daniel is significant due to all the memories we made together and because he’s my best friend. Daniel was the more creative, fun, and mischievous one between us. For example, one day when he and I were together and we were bored he thought of this game called “adventures” and I would always look forward to playing with him. Daniel to me was like a role model and if it weren’t for him I wouldn’t be me today. Although Daniel moved away not too long ago he and I are still best friends and if it weren’t for him I wouldn’t be the person I am today.

Growing up as a kid I would say I was different from the average American kid. And not only was I different so was my home/ lifestyle. I found out from experience that there’s no place like my home. My family is from Bosnia and in Bosnia we do things different than here. Even though I was born here in Georgia, I’m still very Bosnian due to my family. For example, in our culture we don’t wear shoes in the house; I learned to take off my shoes whenever I enter a house. I was different and unique because my parents weren’t really accustomed to the American life and they wanted me to retain all of our Bosnian culture but America changes you. America changes you because surviving in America is different than Bosnia. In Bosnia it would be easier to find a job, make money, and live a regular life but I had to forget about simplicity and an easy life and get accustomed to our economy. Although life may be harder here in America when I’m home everything is easy that’s why I love being home.
Now that I’m all grown and finishing high school soon I see my home and family in a different way. I understand everything my parents were trying to retain and teach me but still accept that I had to change to survive in America. Just like my mom had to learn English so she could get a job and provide for me and my family I had to do the same to provide for me and now also for my mom and dad. I also realized home isn’t home without your family and your family doesn’t only consist of blood relatives. An actual family for me consists of my blood relatives and my friends Daniel, Elvis, and Donny. If it weren’t for every one of them home would never be the same. They all created me and created my home to be the way it is today.

So when you think about it there’s really no place like home, and that doesn’t just include me it includes the whole world. I’m, sure everyone feels the same. If it weren’t for me moving into this house, for me meeting Daniel, for me changing to get accustomed to the American way of life I wouldn’t be here today and I wouldn’t be the [...] I am today.Prompt: ?
Many states are known by their stereotypes and other people around the world actually believe those stereotypes. New Jersey is one of those places that people believe only loud mouth and reckless citizens reside there. However, that is only what is shown on television just for the amusement of society. This voluptuous state is full of way more than just their stereotypes, we represent equality and togetherness. Being born and raised there, has taught me how to be a mature young lady. It has also taught me that your family can be spanned out across an entire state, and they will always be there for you. New Jersey is a place that I know well and that will stay in my heart no matter where I travel to.
I lived in a small town that resided in Bergen County called Hackensack. It shared a small area with two other towns; Englewood and Teaneck. These towns were so small that you could walk over the bridge and you would be in Teaneck. Everything was so close to each other and it was very convenient in any type of emergency situations. Walking down the streets of Hackensack, you could just smell the aroma of flowers sprouting from the ground and smoke from the buses. You could hear people greeting you every five seconds that you walked down the street with a warm ‘Hello”. People always had bright smiles on their faces like they had all won the lottery, even when it was like a blizzard during December. I lived near a diner called Fairmount Diner, Target and B&W Bakery, which were right across from the train tracks. You could smell pancakes dripping in syrup from the diner and freshly baked pastries containing sugar and flour from a mile away.

Hackensack became a gigantic influence on the way that I live my life. It has molded me into the model young woman that I have grown to be. Even after moving to Georgia, Hackensack is still in my heart no matter what and always will be. It was just one of those places that allowed me to be as creative as Leonardo da Vinci and I have learned to express that in my current location too. Whether it be through writing or drawing, I am a creative person. New Jersey taught me about family, equality and individualism in many ways that I could never possibly forget. That is the one place that means a lot to me and I am planning on going back really soon. I will be going back to see old friends and reconnect with all my family. Hackensack, New Jersey is a place that I know well and is also a place that will stay in my heart forever.Prompt: ?

Many things in life help you become a better person and make you see how you should be. In my life there was one thing that really made be treat people differently and really began to love life. This was something that hit me like a fast ball and it was something that changed me forever.
Heart beating fast, eyes bulged, Nothing was more important than this moment. I gave all my focus in to my cousin as she picked which hand the freshly covered in copper penny was in. My expressions and body turned firey inside and out as she somehow managed to pick the right hand again. Me becoming envious decided to change it up and do anything so that my cousin wouldn’t win. The first thing that came to my head was that I should hide the penny in my cloths but I only had on my non pocketed jean dress and I had no pockets to hide them there so that was out of the question. The last and most secure place to me to hide the penny was in my warm moist mouth. At the time this seemed like a very intelligent Idea. Until my cousin chose a empty hand and I opened up my mouth and me still being the jealous person that I am decided I never wanted her to even see the penny again so I had made a decision that wasn’t well thought out.

I swallowed it! When it happened I could taste the copper slowly go half way down my throat. It happened so fast that I didn’t realize that I had done something complet  ley wrongPrompt: ?

Chorus Room

Who am I? I always repeat that question to myself. I realize that I’m a different person then I was three years ago. When I view myself in the mirror I don’t see all the agonizing misery that once took a place in me. I recognize a different person, someone who is overjoyed and at peace within their self. I only found this new conception because of a chorus room.

High School pointed out all my flaws the moment I walked down the street at 6:25 a.m. to get to the bus stop on time. I arrived at this huge contraption at 6:45 a.m. As I walked in feeling apprehensive and insecure seeing all the different types of people. I found myself trying to find a familiar face to socialize with, but instead I ended going to my first class of a new environment.
In first period looking at 4 white walls and too timid to try and make conversation to new people… in comes some old friends and I was so excited to see them and start to make conversation. And soon it was time for Chorus. Chorus ended up being my safe place. A place where I could be myself and no one could judge me. I met all kind of different people in, and two of them became my best friends. They brought me out my shell and opened this new person that is present here today.

The Berkmar High School Chorus Room changed my life completely. I never was in a place where I felt so welcomed and felt like I belong. I always had to hide who I was because the fear of being rejected by society. But I wasn’t rejected, I was accepted for all my flaws something that High School didn’t do. High School pointed out all flaws but The Chorus Room made me embrace my flaws. It was the best thing that could ever happen to me.
I grew and grew into a person you wouldn’t even recognize three years ago, by my looks, maybe a little. Yes, not by the way I walked or talked or even the way I ate. But by how jubilant I was how nothing bothered me even loosing friends.Prompt: Discuss the greatest challenge you have faced or expect to face.

People face a lot of different challenges throughout their lives. Some are able it to make it through and others just quit and fall off. Well I am not a quitter. I have faced challenges before and if I have to go through that situation again; I am sure that I will succeed.Prompt: ?

The person that has the most influence on me in life is superman, or you can say one of the strongest people I know……my dad. He’s like my backbone that keeps me straight. There’s so many different thing I have learned from him and YouTube. I look up to my dad, because he goes out to work every day to provide and help my mom, sister, and me. I can tell working year round is not easy, but you got to do what you got to do. He’s taught me how to not waist money depending on other people to do the same thing I can do. There’s no telling where I’d be without him.

He raised me to not be dependent on others, and different ways to make money the clean way. He introduced me to many different things that I know for a fact I wouldn’t be doing without him today. We hang out more as best friends more than farther than son. Year round we are working and riding our horse. During fall and winter we hunt, and in the summer time only I fish. Mainly because he’s not too good at it like I am. He’s the one that taught me most of the laws of life that I know. The top two of them is “Every day is a new day”, and “Learn from yesterday, live for today, and hope for tomorrow”. Sometimes I think about what if I wake up one morning and he’s not there anymore.Prompt: ?
Its 12:34 a.m. and I wake up frightened that I hear the phones from my job ringing. Ever since that moment forward I realized that needed to go to college that I wouldn’t be able to work at a fast food like Pizza Hut. In life, there are challenges you have to change to be a better person in your future. In this moment, I realized didn’t want to work at a place where I would be bossed around in a way that I felt uncomfortable. I have faced many different situations to the point where I feel that I can’t be having someone treat me this way. Thanks to this job I’ve realized that I need to work hard to get easy money. In other words, I need to go to college and face another hard challenge to get to where I can make easy money and not have to deal with people treating me however they want.

As a young teenager you want to make your own money to get your own things. In high school you face many situations and challenges in which you realize you need to be more dependent on yourself then your parents. Now as a senior I have realized its worth coming this long way and doing all I had to do to get where I am today. I am thankful for everyone that has helped me along the way and has pushed me to keep going. When I first started working my family supported me telling me if I didn’t like the job because if I did it would mean I liked easy money in a way that isn’t fair. In other words, it would not be right that I would work so hard to get so little money.There are many places in the world that can change a person. It could be a church or a certain place that you visited. It all can affect you from the way that they act, to the Future decisions you make. One place in significance many can relate to is prison. One place that I may Say has changed me is the football field. This place in many ways has changed me to become a better Individual.
To begin with, being on the football field alone conjures up memories good and bad. One way that it has changed me to be a better individual, is to always work hard. A moto that has always been self-evident every time I suit up, and walk on to the football field. For instance, one memory that comes to mind is the very first time I step foot on the field. I could remember it like it was yesterday. It was a Tuesday evening and hot as devils toes. The sweat trickled down into my eyes where it began to burn with no chance of it stopping at all. Then the coach called for individuals. I could not have taken another second of this. My knees began to tremble under the weight of my fatigue, but then one of the head coaches pulled me aside and told me calmly, “ you got this son, just keep going and never, the pain of today will be your gain tomorrow, I believe that you will go far.” Ever since then have always worked hard.

Continuing my boxing career is one of the best decisions I have ever made. Because as a kid I loved things that were physically involved .However it may seems very easy sport. But it’s really not. Meanwhile looking at the TV while two fighters are taking the hits may seem a little cool. But the fact that it can damage their brain in a long term. However it’s hard to believe .Let us not forget that boxing is still one of the best sports that was invented during ancient Greece and Rome.

Since I was 8 year old I loved boxing. I use to watch it a lot. I basically like sports that physically involve punching. Meanwhile I am new to United States of America .on the other hand, there was an Afghani family that that just moved to USA. My family knew them well. However one day I was watching a boxing match and he saw me .He asked me if I want to join a boxing club? Well he was a great boxer in Colombia .he had won a lot of trophy and medals and etc.Bascially the next day he takes me to the gym and my training begins. However know that he knew I loved boxing and how I take it serious. He decided that he will train me very seriously and he won’t take it easy on me. However, for some reason I love his idea about training me very seriously .Because there are two different types of athletics in this world. One that takes it serious just like it’s his or her passion. On the second hand there people who does for the time killer or the money. Well to me doing a sport for money is stupid idea. However there’s people in world that does it for the money or to kill time. But however to me boxing as always been my sport, and my passion.

It was early in morning. The sky was still dark. While we were in car, going to Gym.my coach said today is a big day for you.when we arrive in the gym .I Saw couple of parents there and couple of students. It was a big day for me.It was my first boxing match. The first round went very well .But however during round nine, my hands were giving up.it was hard for me to see.Becuase I was stuck in a corner. However every time I would try to clinch on him. He would throw a jab and hook. Which was hard for me stay on balance. He would try to unbalance me but it wouldn’t work. Now that round nine was over my coach told me this is the round that I have to go full power. Because we can’t take the risk of going all twelve rounds. So the round started and I was dizzy I was acting like I was okay. But I got caught with a hook and he put into his corner. And he landed a lot of punches .But meanwhile I was waiting for him to do a single mistake and KO him. He seemed very tired. We still had a minute left on the clock. Well he drop his hands and my reaction was fast I duck down and jabbed him twice and I throw a right hook which made him off balance .From that point it was my turn so I throw many punches and my last punch KO him. And I won the match. Everybody thinks that boxing is an easy sport. It’s not it take time to build speed and power punches. From that point on I learn my lesson no to wait for opponent to attack first. I should always start off.

To conclude, boxing has always been part of my life. To me boxing is like having a best friend beside you. “According to some, boxing is just a sport, but according to me is not just sport, it’s my passion, my life.”

I have faced plenty of challenges but the most important one that I expect to face is going to college. However, I just think of myself everyday of where I will be in the future. College is one of the most important things in someone’s life because without college you’re going to stay getting paid $7.25 an hour. College is a must have I see people every day struggling because they didn’t went to college. I think that everyone should go to college if they want to be successful.

People that go to college great treated different then everyone else because people know that they are going to be successful people in life. The other people that don’t go to college get treated like crap. For example, I know my cousin that work at a mall and they were clowning him because he didn’t have a high school diploma. You don’t want to be like my cousin because even if someone asks you if you graduated you will feel embarrassed to say no. That’s why it’s important to go to school and do what you have to do to get that education.Prompt: ?

About 300,000 kids in America that plays high school football .Only 2,000 of those kids receive division 1 scholarship to college.100 of those 2,000 kids that make it to college go to the next level and that’s the NFL and most of them won’t make the team. Well I’m one of those 300,000 kids that is fighting against the odds to be able to earn a college scholarship. It’s a tough challenge that I have to face it’s my senior year, and I have no, stars, no ranks, and only one way out.

Year after year hearing the sound of a buzzer going off and hearing cheering and joy, but not from the people beside you nor behind you, but across the field of grass another team has defeated you again.

Definitely to the underclassmen who are the future of our program.Prompt: ?

The definition of challenges is to arouse of one’s action or effort to stimulate the quality or requiring full use of one’s ability, and energy. One of the greatest challenges that I am facing right now is high school. Why is high school my biggest challenge you might ask. Well it’s simple deciding what to do with your life after high school, what career, and what field. All can take a lot and put stress on you.

My challenge is to finish high school and decide what to do with my life. For some of you who do not know. High school is not what you expect it to be like. Walking the hallways felt like an evening commute home on the I-85. The school lunch can only be described as a weeks ago bread. Every day you walk/drive home exhausted. Some days I would come home not remembering anything at school. I would always question myself.

The hardest part about a high school life is to get past the distraction you face every-day. Walking to class in the traffic filled hallway, my lungs rapidly pace itself, my muscle straining itself, and all to do what. Walk through the hall. So much work just to walk in the hallway. Why it is that people like to hang out at the doorway. No common sense. Doors are meant for walking through, not standing and blocking it while people try to push their ways across.

Out of all the little distraction I face every-day, one challenge still remain. What would I do after high school? After 4 years of high school I can still not make up my mind. There are many options but I cannot pick which is the best for me. What college should I go to, what field should I do what about the military? All the questions I want to answer but simply cannot.

In conclusion, I am currently trying my best to figure out what to do with my life after high school. I do not know whether I am going to which college or if I am to attend the military. Whatever happens in the future will happen depending on my actions this year. After all what is the point of a challenge if it doesn’t make you try your best.Prompt: Discuss a place that has changed you

Have you ever been told that the whole point of life is learning to live with the consequences of the bad decisions we’ve made. It only takes a place and a wrong decision to change your life around and sometimes your future plans. To me it all happened around the end of the school year of senior year. I was a 16 year old girl attending Berkmar High School. I decided to drop out of high school to have a job and depend on myself because of family problems I had a sick dad who got fire and a stepmom who only work part time. My only choice was to help and hold down my family. Dropping out of high school is an issue face by many teens today including me unfortunately. There are many causes to drop out of school but with those causes come many negative effects. Out of those effects I learn that school is really important and brightens anyone’s future as so makes our career easy.

School was really a waste of time for me. I had zero interest. I’m sure school is a huge benefit if you are actually interested. But it only was making me angry and depressed. I honestly never thought I would drop out of high school. I loved school; I love learning, being organized and the socializing when I was in elementary school to middle school. Things change; sometimes they changed in bad ways. I was very hurt and felt like I was worthless for not being able to continue my education I was basically committed to demonstrate to my family and friends that I was that one person with honors cords and the crowd cheering me while I walk to receive my diploma. A lot of those people were disappointed at me. I felt like I was the definition of a high school dropout. At that point I decided to help my family out since money was needed around that year. I told my dad my decision and he agree he said he understands I want to help them out but he told me I had to promise I will come back to school and graduate. As a teen I just want the best for me and my future family so of course I will be a high school graduate and a collage graduate as well.

There are many reasons why any dropout decides school is not for them as many people say now days. I was once one of them. I kept telling myself that I wouldn’t graduate on time I was already behind. All those negative thoughts made me not believe in me anymore. I started skipping classes. I didn’t care about school anymore, I didn’t care about my grades anymore not even the classes I was doing good at. At the end of the year I decided to drop out what the point of going to classes is when I was already failing them I kept asking myself. Until the day came when I decided to not go to school anymore and be welcome to the real life “having a job and depending on you.”

During that time I was struggling to find a job. I felt like nobody was there for me. Everybody was still going to school to finish what I couldn’t finish my junior year. I felt left behind alone and helpless until I met a friend who works as a waitress. I told her what was going on and if she could help me find a place to work at her job. Finally they hire me at her job at that point I was really happy and felt like everything was getting better. I hated working every day from 2pm-2am I got home really tired I wanted to give up but I would have felt like a loser until I realize how hard and stressful is to work. To remind you it was my first job at age 16. I hated the job I knew this wasn’t for me that’s when I realize and open my eyes and told myself what was I doing here. I rather wanted to be at school then working somewhere I hated it.

Finally summer came I decided to go to summer school and finish some classes. I was doing goo still manage to go to work. Then finalyPrompt: ?

The smell of salt in the air and women in bikinis all around us. What would you think your at? The beach of course a place where most would spend spring break at or for just relaxation. This place I know well is Myrtle Beach, SC just place I can’t forget. I do have feelings for this place I didn’t spend much time their but I really have somewhere in my heart I could not forget.

To start off why this place means something to me is because my dad choose this play to spend time there as a family, well now since he is not with us anymore that place is just a reminder of my pops. Not just of the memories I have of it is special it is also a beautiful resort I would recommend to others to enjoy. With its crystal blue waters and a great view of the atlantic ocean something you can’t see everyday.“Dad, where’s mom” I asked. My dad looks over, sighs, and says to me “She’s Working son. She’ll be home later”. I’d look up at him, and see my dad smile at me like there’s nothing wrong, and hug me. My dad knows that I and my sister know that she’s been leaving. He didn’t want us to worry because we were just kids. So he’d make up things like “She’s working” or “She’s at the store”. My dad was having a hard accepting the she was leaving, and so were we. Abandonment doesn’t just affect the other parent but the kids as well.

As a kid I knew something was wrong but I didn’t know what. I could hear yelling from my parents especially from my dad. I’d hear bits of what they were saying. My dad “You need to stop….” My mom “I’m going….” I hear a door slam and just curl up in my bed, blanket covering me, hiding. My mother was like any other mom working, cooking, cleaning, etc. then she got into gambling. At my age I didn’t know what that was. A little after that she would go missing. It started with a couple of days to weeks. I don’t know what my mom was thinking. She had five kids my older sister, me, my little sister, and twin boys. My mother had taken up a gambling problem. My mother would take my dad’s money and go to a casino. Win or lose she’d go. She lost so much at one point that we lost our house. Not just that house but two more after that. She’d come back to my dad all broke, but he wouldn’t care because he loved her. Once she was back the cycle would happen again. This happened until we were going to another house and she brought along her “friend”. I say “friend” because she told my dad he was just a friend but in reality she played him. That “friend” turned out to be the guy she ran off with. Him over my dad. It left my dad devastated.

My dad had a hard time accepting that she had left him for another man. That she had gave up on her husband and kids. He couldn’t handle the fact she had did not want him. My father wasn’t the same after that. He’d throw himself into work. If he was home he’d be working on something. He became silent not talking. My dad has never been through this. So he didn’t know how to deal with something like this. How can you. The night that he found out that she was leaving I found my dad in his room crying. My father is crying. I couldn’t help but just hug him. It was my dad. A man I never thought can cry. I found him at the edge of his bed shaking his head while slow tears just falling from his cheeks. He hears me come in with my older sister, and tries to wipe up his tears. Saying he’s fine don’t worry. My dad is a very prideful person. He never wanted us to see him weak or down so he would always be happy no matter what. It was just sad because he wasn’t the only person who was struggling. My sister and I were too

Like my dad I was having a hard time dealing with this issue. I felt it was my fault. Like I could’ve done something to change what happened. Like what can I do to bring her back. What can I do. I had many trust issues built on this. I didn’t trust anyone because I felt as if they weren’t telling the truth. I didn’t trust that people would stay in my life. I felt like what’s next to go, my dad. I felt like I could never believe in happily ever after. I thought I will be alone all my life. I became emotionally depressed. Because my mother had left with no emotion at all. Just packed up and left. This was the moment I felt abandoned. From there I isolated myself from everyone and everything. I didn’t want to let people come into my life and just leave like she did. I built my wall to keep anyone from getting in friends, family anyone. I’ve been like this for years but keep it to myself. I didn’t feel the need to open up to anyone.
Years passed by now and I’m eighteen now. I still have issues but I’m trying to get passed it. I’ve accepted she has left. I’ve been trying to get back in life and experience it. I have a better perspective on thing and how they work. It hard but I found what I want to do and be in life. I want to be a psychologist. I want to be a psychologist because I want to help treat the minds of other so they don’t have to feel like I have or bad in anyway. I made my goal out of this situation. My goal in life is to help anyone and everyone so they can be happy in life. It doesn’t matter friends, family, strangers anyone that feels sad or mad or even alone. I want to help them.Prompt: ?

One of the places’ I know best is where my parents were born and raised. This place is where I can find freedom. Every year I go visit I feel like an eagle soring throw the blue sky. My heart starts to race every time my family and I go visit. Every year we go visit my parents family, it shows me that family is what really matters in life.
The first year I visited my parents’ home town was when I was ten years old. We had left the house around two in the morning on a Saturday night. That night my mom and dad where ready with the luggage and everything in my dad’s ford f-350 (king ranch). My brother and sister had woken up when I walked in there room and told them to get ready so we could leave. While my brother and sister started to get read, my mom started to look for our passports, while my dad checked the truck for anything that might cause a problem with it.

After my mom and dad had done everything they needed to do we headed off on the freeway. My brother and sister half asleep in the truck and, my mom and dad as well. Me on the other hand, my heart was still racing and just jumping with joy inside. My dad started driving and it would take us one full day and three more hours just to get to the border. My mom and dad toke turns drive and I also helped them out a little as well. After the long drive we finally reached the border and there were a lot of people there. The line to cross the border was very long, more than the down town Atlanta traffic is on a game day. After the 3 hours we spent at the border we were ready to hit the road again. It was my dad’s turn to drive again, pulse he was the only one that know the shortest way to get there without taking the long way like last time.Prompt: ?

Three specific things about me is I like American History, because you can learn so much about American in some many classes. So I want to go to college get my major in history and might become a teacher on day.
Another specific thing about me is that I’m a hard working person, I ask questions we need, and always caring about each other. So I hope to keep that positive feeling with me till I die.

The Final specific thing about me is my family is Athletic, because my parents played sports while there were young and in high school. My sister is playing two sports right now Softball and Basketball, but I’m the only person that doesn’t play high school sports. But I still play sports after school.
So I hope that you let me in your University to played sport and be a positive student in life. Also to accomplish my goals I set while I’m there.Prompt: ?

Donald Trump wants to beat everyone in poles but where does he really stand in the economy? Lately all he has been arguing about is immigration insisting that Mexican immigrants were “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs, they’re bringing crime, they’re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.” and arguing Mexican immigrants bring “tremendous infectious disease” to the country, which is not true, not just that but threating tariffs because he is “rich” as he claims in CNN news. “I’m rich and not using lobbyists. I’m not using donors. I don’t care I’m rich” and expects us to believe that he’s really going to makes U.S.A a better place when he plans to hurt people and family’s and doesn’t care about other races other than the legal people whom according to him do not make crimes or are not spreading diseases

As many people have heard Donald Trump is working with Univision as head management in miss U.S.A pageant. as soon as this 20015 pageant ends he claims that he is not satisfied because of a “non-completed agreement in his contract.” When in reality he is just trying to make an honest buck out of Univision that happened to be the biggest Hispanic news industry and the TNT network news interview him and ask him “do you regret the comments?” Donald Trump: ”Not at all had I said people from all over the country” TNT network: “how much are you sewing them for?” Donald Trump: “I’m sewing them for a tremendous amount of money for defamation” when really the person who should be sewed for defamation is him for saying people from the middle east and Islamic people are destroying our country

The real question is do we really want a guy to run for America? He can barely hold his tongue when it’s his turn to speak, just common sense as a child, even a child knows better. they know when they are permitted to speak and when they should start speaking and how without being rude if you ask me I believe Donald trump was a troubled child and still is today don’t get it wrong he has good qualities but I still feel he shouldn’t be given such a higher power when his idea of respect is as ideal as a three year old child.Late ArrivalsPrompt: Who is someone you look up to and why?

There are many different people that come in and out of your life. All of them teach you different things. Some come in to teach you how to survive, and others just to mess your life up. Many of the people that stay are the ones who love you and the ones you learn to love. The very two first people that will teach you everything are your parents. My prime example is my dad.

My dad is literally a pain in the neck when it comes to my studies and school work. He’s always on my back when he comes home from work. “Kevin get off your phone, that’s not helping you study!” I always seem to make the same dumb mistake by saying,” yeah dad I did that already.” Usually he always likes checking my homework. He is such a perfectionist, doesn’t like not even the slightest mistake. My dad is also always asking about my grades. Like any other parent he turns into a loud parakeet and yells at me if I have a bad grade, but never does he hit me for any reason.
My dad has probably taught me the most valuable things in life. When he was only fifteen years old, he was in the army back in El Salvador. After one year he decided to run away from the military and flee his country. When he arrived to the U.S. his mom told him he had to work, because she didn’t have enough money for the both of them. My dad has been independent ever since. He always tells me how I should value my life and that I should appreciate that I have both my parents. With my dad I can play around but he’s also showed me when it’s time to be serious. My dad is like my mentor. He always pesters me about how I shouldn’t do a lot of the things he did, because he doesn’t want to see me suffering like he did.

This man has always been there for me. Blood is thicker than water they say, and my dad has proved that to me. There’s never a time I don’t like going out to work with my dad. he’s taught me so much of the things he knows. Always says that when he dies he wants me to be known the way he is. My dad has never given me a bad example. Yes he may drink and stuff but he always likes to do it behind our backs so we won’t see him. He’s never offered us anything and even though he says you should try a lot of things at least once, the way he’s raised me I could never. He has always been there for me and my family. Never had we had to suffer the way he did. There’s always been a roof on our heads, clothes on our body, and food in our mouth. He may not seem like a big deal to you, but when I grow up I want to be just like my dad and if possible even better.

I’m very lucky to have a man like that in life. He has always stuck by my side no matter what. My dad has taught me what it’s like to be a man. All the memories he’s given me I will never forget. All the stories he’s told me I hope to pass down to my kids. I want my dad to be remembered for an eternity. I look up to my dad because he’s the greatest dad alive!I am uniquely qualified as a vet because of my love for animal’s, past experience and achieving my goals and accomplishments.
My passion for animals is to love them in many ways, giving them their different needs. Figuring out the problems by performing good connections and communication. I am willing to heal the broken hearts and outer skins on the helpless animals and not only the pets but the pet owners.

In my 19 years I’ve grown up with pets all my life, so I am aware of the requirements into keeping a pet and providing the right care for them, I’ve learned that every day I am learning something new about different species and still want to continue to gain new knowledge.

Studying animals all my life has also made me want to participate in an actual animal shelter, and maybe my own someday, I plan to better myself into the new things that come my way to help these animals and teach others the right way.essayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessay12Embed"

We are not the same, I am too reckless

And they about to call the wrong attention
And I don't got no patience, no more testin'
I do shit how I want, don't need no blessin'
XO niggas ain't nothin' to mess with
Nobody stoppin' us, oh, no, we destined
And everybody 'round you is so basic
I'm never rockin' white, I'm like a racist
I don't drink my liquor wit' a chase in
That money is the only thing I'm chasin'
And some dope dimes on some coke lines
Gimme head all night, cum four times
Baby girl just wanna smoke a pound
Do an ounce, get some dick, tell her friends about it

She calls my phone up, but I told her, ""I'm a loner"" (Uh)
But she likes my watch and my droptop and my persona (Uh)
We hit the highway, one-five-five with my whole foot on the dash
She's in my ear, she's got no fear, she could care less if we crash

But on my radar, I've got some nerve to play hard
I waited for my chance, but playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance

Teatime like I got a cup of this shit
Tee time like golf at a quarter to six
I love to fuck on a regular bitch
Famous hoes lame, but they stay on my dick
Heard your new joint, it's embarrassing, shit
You talk to the cops on some therapist shit
You act like you love this American shit
But, really, the truth is you scared of the 6
Yeah, you scared of the 6
Yeah, you scared of the 6
Your bodyguard put in some work on a fluke
Now you wanna go and inherit that shit
Don't talk to the boy 'bout comparisons, shit
Or come to the boy on some arrogant shit
The weapons we got are some terrorist shit
Like TV producers we, grr, we airing this shit
She askin' for bread for her parents and shit
I told her I don't got no cash and she said she could wait on a rack, on some Arabic shit
I pull out a million and stare at the shit
My dick just got hard 'cause a wire just hit
My schedule is out, come spin us, for real
Man, fuck all that spinnin' the narrative shit
I melt down the chains that I bought from yo' boss
Give a fuck about all of that heritage shit
Since V not around, the members done hung up the Louis, they not even wearing that shit
Don't come to the boy 'bout repairing some shit
Don't come to the boy about sparing some shit
You lucky that Vogue was suing 'cause I would've been with the Wassas in Paris and shit

Am I picture-perfect or do I look fried?
All of that green and yellow, that drip from your eyes is tellin'
Tell you demise, I went to my side
To push back the ceilin' and push back the feelings, I had to decide
I replay them nights, and right by my side, all I see is a city of people that ride wit' me

I take me a bean and I turn to a beast
Bought the crib on a hill, made it harder to reach
Bought a couple more whips 'cause I needed more speed
Bought a couple more watches, I needed more time
Didn't buy the condo, it was smarter to lease
And I bought some more ice 'cause I brought in the heat
Made a cast of my dick, so she never gon' cheat

Picture being locked in a box
Selling beats 'cause you need dollars
They say I can make it to the league, mama
500 dollars all we need, mama
Then we gon' be on
Tired of seeing the lights off
Pops heatin' up the stove
Was close to stealing and killing, now just to get 'em on
Couple drinks down of Rosé
I'm tipsy, y'all faces done look like an emoji
The RAV4 turned into a Rover
'Til it took flight and ended up on the shoulder
Now our money a little longer
Lookin' back how we finnesin', we ain't know shit
They gave me three, got twenty-five on the low
Who knew that lump sum would get me on?
My fifteen seconds last a little longer, longer

Now God made coal for the men who sold their lives to West Van Lear
And you keep on diggin' 'til you get down there where it's darker than your darkest fears
And that woman in the kitchen she keeps on cookin' but she ain't had meat in years
Just live off bread, live off hope in a pool of a million tears

[Verse 2]
Now let me tell you somethin' 'bout the gospel
And make sure that you mark it down
When God spoke out ""Let there be light""
He put the first of us in the ground
And we'll keep on diggin' 'til the comin' of the Lord
And Gabriel's trumpet sounds
'Cause if you ain't minin' for the company, boy
There ain't much in this town

[Chorus]
We could've made somethin' of ourselves out there if we'da listened to the folks that knew
That coal is gonna bury you

[Verse 3]
Now it's darker than a dungeon
And it's deeper than a well
So sometimes I imagine
That I'm gettin' pretty close to hell
And in my darkest hour
I cry out to the Lord
He says ""Keep on minin' boy
'Cause that's why you were born""

Tyler Childers,Rock Salt and Nails,"4 ContributorsRock Salt and Nails Lyrics[Verse 1]
By the banks of the river
Where the willows hang down
The wild birds, they warble
With a low moanin' sound
Way down in the hollow
Where the river runs cold
It was there I first listened
To the lies that you told
Now I lie on my back
And I see your sweet face
The past I remember
Time can't erase
And the letters you wrote me
They were written in shame
And I know that your conscience
Still echoes my name

[Verse 2]
Now if the ladies were blackbirds
If the ladies were thrushes
Well I'd lie there for hours
In the chilly cold marshes
And if the women were squirrels
With them high bushy tails
Well I'd load up my shotgun
With rock salt and nails

You remind me of a Sunday
Back home in ol' Kentucky
With the church choirs just beltin' to the pines
And I love you like the mountains
Love's the way the mornin' opens
To a soft and bright greetin' from the sun

[Chorus]
So if it'd make you stay
I wouldn't act so angry all the time
I wouldn't keep it all inside
And I'd let you know how much I loved you every day
So darlin' will you stay right here and shake this frost off of my bones

[Verse 2]
Well I used to ride a Mustang
And I'd run that thing on high hopes
'Til they raised the price of dreams so high I couldn't pay
So I let that car just sit there
When I should've took you driving
With the windows down while the music played

[Chorus]
So if it'd make you stay
I wouldn't act so angry all the time
I wouldn't keep it all inside
And I'd let you know how much I loved you every day

I couldn't stand seeing people fucking theyselves up like that on the shit
And that's where the money came from

I warned you before you supersized my fries with that dollar
You got a daughter, shit's getting harder
The only thing you wanna bunk her was your freedom
You can't afford to get caught up but you in too deep
And the seashore ain't saw ya
You got a mother, she don't support you
But you bought her a new house cause you love her
Growing up you barely had a roof
Now you got a coupe and it doesn't have a roof
I guess you're accustomed what you're used to
So you bought two, nigga
They coming for you, nigga
Niggas be hating, I'm doing them bitches
Like Susan and Karen be doing your pockets
And running the man and he's losing his fucking mind
And it's all an illusion
Who was alludin' all of this potent?
I am the reason your family is using and shooting up
It's my fault
You can, blame me, motherfucker
For killing your aunties and uncles
The hustle and hunger
All I wanted was a cheeseburger
And a little chain, tucked
Didn't realize this game fucked, up some lives
Oh, how's mine?
My conscience eats it up all the time but, other than that, I'm fine

So if it goes down, the shit's floodin' in then I won't drown

Only for if mandem move awkwardly when I'm out the ends
But that depends, I'm tryna blow your back as friends
Off again, smash again, that's your friend? Accident
Actions tend to cause a reaction 'cause I'm passionate
They ain't tryna ration it, layin' in the gas they lit
Trained to be passive in the passa, man are pacifist
But pack a fist punch, knuckle sandwich and a bag of chips
Praised as a myth, young legend and the catalyst
But know that who they brand could be the baddest but ain't matchin' with the-

Nights out in west, FaceTime me on the speaker phone
I don't like to speak with man around me, but to each their own
I reach the zone, they crawled around me like they Jesus home

Had to took a toll in profit, fuck it
Do it on my own and buss it, watch it

Need a heatеr and a vest outside
You was watching and hoping I clock it
In the left seat of your best friend's ride

[Intro]
Yo creo en muchas cosas que no he visto, y ustedes también, lo sé
No se puede negar la existencia de algo palpado por más etéreo que sea
No hace falta exhibir una prueba de decencia de aquello que es tan verdadero
El único gesto es creer o no
Algunas veces hasta creer llorando
Se trata de un tema incompleto porque le falta respuesta
Respuesta que alguno de ustedes, quizás, le pueda dar
Es un tema en technicolor para hacer algo útil del amor
Para todos nosotros, amén

[Verso 1]
Oh, ¿qué será?, ¿qué será?
Que anda suspirando por las alcobas
Que se oye susurrando en versos de trova
Que anda combinándonos preguntas locas
Que anda en las cabezas, anda en las bocas
Que anda ascendiendo por hartos huecos
Que están hablando alto en la bodega
Y grita en el mercado, ¿qué cosa es esa?
Es la naturaleza, ¿será?, ¿qué será? (¿Será?, ¿qué será?)
Que no tiene certeza, y nunca te da (Y nunca te da)

[Intro: Raekwon & Method Man]
What that nigga want, God?
Word up, look out for the cops though (Wu-Tang five finger shit, fam)
Cash rules-
Word up, two for fives over here, baby
Word up, two for fives, niggas got garbage down the way
Word up, know what I'm sayin'?
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M. get-
Yeah, check this old fly shit out, word up
(Cash rules everything around me) Take you on a natural joint
(C.R.E.A.M. get the money)
(Dollar, dollar bill, y'all) Here we, here we go, check this shit, yo

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Stayin' alive was no jive
Had second hands, Mom's bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo, rockin' the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way I begin the G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this, son
Rollin' with this one and that one, pullin' out gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend
Started smokin' woolies at 16
And runnin' up in gates and doin' hits for high stakes
Makin' my way on fire escapes
No question, I would speed for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question, I would flow off and try to get the dough all
Stickin' up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick-ass clique and went all out
Catchin' keys from 'cross seas
Rollin' in MPV's, every week we made forty G's
Yo, nigga, respect mine, or here go the TEC-9
Ch-chick-pow! Move from the gate now

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
It's been twenty-two long, hard years, I'm still strugglin'
Survival got me buggin', but I'm alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause shit is deep
A man with a dream with plans to make cream
Which failed; I went to jail at the age of fifteen
A young buck sellin' drugs and such, who never had much
Tryin' to get a clutch at what I could not—
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacin', goin' upstate's my destination
Handcuffed in the back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
But as the world turned, I learned life is hell
Livin' in the world no different from a cell
Every day I 'scape from Jakes givin' chase
Sellin' base, smokin' bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed, and I ask: What's it worth?
Ready to give up, so I seek the old Earth
Who explained workin' hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stick-up kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks and stray shots
All on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth
But shorty's runnin' wild, smokin' sess, drinkin' beer
And ain't tryna hear what I'm kickin' in his ear
Neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
That what? That life is hectic
[Chorus: Method Man & Inspectah Deck]
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar, dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me (My niggas gots to do what they gotta do)
C.R.E.A.M., get the money

Cash rules everything around me (Because you can't just get by no more)

They say the sun shines for all
But in some people world, it never shine at all

[Chorus: YG Marley]
These roads of flames are catching on fire
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Showed you I loved you, you called me a liar
Oh, no-no, no, no, no

[Verse 1: YG Marley]
Baby, tell me where you gone, gone, gone?
I've been fiendin' for your love so long
We can praise Jah in the moonlight
Baby, if you with me, better do right
And I've been gone too long
And I'm hoping that you sing my songs (Sing my songs)
I've been on this road for way too long
I've been hoping that we all get along

[Chorus: YG Marley]
These roads of flames are catching on fire
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Showed you I loved you, you called me a liar

[Verse 2: YG Marley]
Give Jah the thanks and praises
I've been on my own, own, own
But we ain't never left alone, 'lone, 'lone
And if I'm tellin' you the feeling is wrong
Relax a little, friend, this won't take too long
And when you're feeling alone
You can call my phone
Is there a better way to go?
Teach them something before they lose their soul
Oh, no-no, no, freedom is the road
Oh, no-no, no, coming in from the cold
Tell them not to sell it, it's worth more than gold
And guiltiness will catch them in the end
Oh yeah, oh yeah
They'll try to manipulate you through your pockets
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Now you're gonna bring the funk with the optic, with the vision
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Trying to control your soul and take control (Oh, no-no, no)
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
No we don't play that game right here to win power
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah

You can go your own way, or leave me, baby

I can tell you ain't about to win, uh

[Verse]
Keep them trucks up on the railing just a little bit longer
Landing make you stronger
Skin to skin with everything I pondered
So we don’t take dishonor for that
Run up my commas, out the way and it won’t be a problem
All my brothers climbing, we repellent to the bottom
Every second spent to never have another autumn
That was back when everyday was solemn
Now, they falling under me, I’m leading every column
Meter doing jumping jacks, I’m leaning on the pedal
So much steam left on the asphalt, they fiending to say hello
Every season, I'ma blast off and reach that different level
Got my head up on a swivel and my hand close to the metal, get the medal
Bring it back to Largo, that P.G. baby never settle
Easy day to get him silent tryna meddle
'Veil adjacent to the pot, you bet not touch it ‘til it settle
And I’m hitting every shot, boy that’s the fucking fundamentals
Push it with conviction, hit this mission on the code
If they said that 'Veil was missing, that shit fiction, on my soul
Ain’t no permission, I envision giving me a simple road
I’m gon' take that trek alone
I’m gon' get it back in gold
Never fitting in that mold
My reflection 1 of 1, these niggas sectioned into rows
My perception one and done, it’s to the next soon as you fold
I attest I’m at they neck, I’m right above they collarbone, uh
Yeah, look, alright, wait
